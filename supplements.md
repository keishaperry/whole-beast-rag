                <p> The <em>Internet Lookbook</em> is a supplement (supporting text) of the quarterly publication WHOLE BEAST RAG. Supplement texts are stand-alone and serve to expand upon the conceptual elements that underline and govern our aesthetic direction and aligning values. Our nature as an entity hinges upon the agreement that all ideas are fluid and that each expression (or derivation) is but one of many potential shapes that might be occupied in its evolution.</p>
                <p>The <em>Internet Lookbook</em> seeks to expose moments of synchronicity across formats while exploiting the derivative channels that the open access cultivates. Emerging connective tissue over various interfaces both challenges hierarchies of information and their origins while forging collaborative structures and systems through which new ideas disseminate.</p>
                <p>TL;DR: A cool zine for the net art weirdos.</p><br>

                <p><em>Ecoute la pluie</em> is a chapbook translation of Michèle Lesbre's novel - published for the first time in English with permission from <a href="http://www.swediteur.com/" target="_blank">SW Editeur</a>.</p>
                <p>Translated by Katie Assef.</p>
                <p>Produced by WHOLE BEAST RAG.</p>
                <p>The French expression <em>travail de perte</em> (practice of loss) refers to a process of self-erasure, the dual stripping of one's identity in order to arrive at a stark core of truth. The narrator of Michèle Lesbre's novel <em>Ecoute la pluie</em> (SW Editeur, 2013) undergoes such a change, literally overnight, after witnessing a man leap to his death in the Parisian métro. Too shaken to board the train to meet her lover, she instead walks the street of Paris, in the rain, until dawn. Her emotional landscape seems to merge with the urban one, which is often described as decaying or forgotten--the city, too, seems stripped of all its defenses, its charms.</p>
                <p>As the narrator wanders, she feels a need to enact and play witness to the moment of trauma, toreenter the scene on the train platform again and again: "...it was at me, and at no one else, thathe had smiled," she repeats to herself, "and toward me that he had moved before he jumped." Thefallen corpse of a stranger becomes the imploding center of her world, and she finds herself goingback and revisiting locations of pain in her past, embarking on a journey that is also her <em>travail de perte</em>.</p><br>
