  name: Ethan Madarieta
  description: "In my writing I am interested in exploring the construction of knowledge as production of identity, and in discovering possibilities for understanding identity through fiction and critical theory. My current project, “Tension, Resistance,” is about two friends stealing/liberating Mexican General Santa Anna’s prosthetic leg from the Military Museum in Illinois, with intentions of returning it to Mexico. The protagonist deems her Mexican contact unsuitable for deconstructing the pejorative history of “disability,” leading her to attempt to amputate her own leg. This story is a “parafiction” (as conceived by Carrie Lambert-Beatty), attempting to make radical possibilities for change 'real' by fomenting the belief that such change already exists and is therefore possible. The project of creating narratives that appear 'real' requires the creation of 'networks of meaning'. This is achieved by entering components of the story into the 'real' world; for example, my story narrativizes history, and retells plausible alternatives to dominant discourses through archival mimicry. In addition, I have created documents and websites that validate the text and blur the line between “real” and fiction. I am a senior at the University of Illinois Urbana and will graduate this May. I am currently working as a certified cosmetologist, writing a novel and an essay informed by the writings of Heidegger, Derrida and Lacan, and awaiting reply to graduate school applications."

  description: "I was lucky enough, in January of this year, to spend two weeks in Havana, Cuba. The trip was too short to formulate any synthesized critique of Cuban-American relations, but jarring and interesting enough to write about. It shed harsh light on the power plays of both the United States and Cuban governments, which both allow a decades-old grudge to dictate policy. This is a personal essay, a questioning of the embargo, and a wondering of the persistent question: What is it to be the American abroad? I graduated from the University of Iowa with a BA in English, and am currently an MFA candidate in creative writing at the University of Minnesota. I was born and raised in Texas."

Born into a fun but attention-seeking family, his first form of expression was the theater at the ripe age of five. Perhaps it was the boredom of growing up in St. Cloud that spurred a diverse set of interests and hobbies. In his 26 years, he has dabbled in music, photography, painting, writing, dance/performance art, Japanese, party-planning, museum studies, installation, drag, mix-taping, and mixology. His most recent epiphany is film, though he strives to be more productive to a society as a whole than to become a critical theorist. More than anything, he wants to go on a long, scenic drive with you. His spirit animal is a meerkat."
