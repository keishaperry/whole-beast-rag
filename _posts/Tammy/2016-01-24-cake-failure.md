I am heavy as earth with all that could go wrong.  
Called my mom, left a message, said I was afraid  
of my birthday cake. It was the ganache that must  
have fucked it up–too runny, too high altitude.  
Was it my attitude? I am making a cake  
on Ash Wednesday. I am afraid it will taste of  
as if I didn’t try. I tried–mom, I’m afraid  
the cake is  
caving  
in. I’m  
afraid  
the cake is  
immolating  
in its own  
skin.

I hate when the cake has skin. So instead I  
made a cake of clay. I made a little doll, put  
her on top, and ate her toes off. I am craving  
the taste of god. The thing inside my body lacks  
sweet teeth or teeth at all. I want to teach it the  
meaning of earth so it does not fear its nature.  
I am practicing, pureeing chalk and slipping  
it into my coffee. I’ve been sneaking uncooked  
rice grains when no one is looking. It wants a mouth  
full of grass for breakfast–who am I to deny  
it what it wants? I’ve been sneaking soil on the  
sly, I have a pocketful of ice. Measure the  
sugar. Measure the spice.  
Measure so it comes out right.

I’ve baked a cake of knives.  
I’ve baked a cake of fire.  
I’ve baked a mud cake with  
real worms. I will bake an  
oyster cake with a pearl  
inside. I will freeze frame  
the moment when someone  
cuts their teeth. Will it be  
you, little girl? Will it  
be you with the half tooth?  
Will it be you buzz cut  
son, my little caon, my  
little con, will you wail  
with all the shriek of a  
rock in your shoe? Will it  
be you my lover, my  
Marlboro man? Though you  
don’t smoke cigarettes.

That’s a sin, or will I  
reverse the lens and snap  
when I have clamped down hard?

Arrive at the field in heels. Come tromp my land, my  
band of strangers, come with your tin trowels. I will  
put you to work  
in my bean field.  
and your reward:

this cake contains pieces of a white snake. You won’t  
even taste it, but when you’re finished you will be  
wise. You will have worked up  
an appetite  
of a kind.

Disaster cake,  
when cut, produces  
a hurricane.

Go out to the  
garden pick a  
shark from the  
squashes.  
Give me its jaws.

Storm’s a-comin’.

Here’s my cake dance.  
Here’s how I step  
from tile to tile.  
Here’s how I make  
a convection, a  
conversation, a  
confession of guilt.

Are you afraid of me?

Don’t be.

I’ve stuck in a pin filling.

Pin me.  
We will marry in spring.
