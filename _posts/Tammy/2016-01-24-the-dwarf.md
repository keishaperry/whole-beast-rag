I ate an apple, and it protested,  
little worm devoured my insides.  
I ate an apple, two strong bites,  
and it came through me twice.

Snow White had her little dwarfs to keep her,  
preserve her under glass, a specimen  
they fantasize about at night.

Sweeper, singer, baker of pies,  
she kept the shortest men happy.  
I string cramps, stings  
along my spine.

I’m plugged into something I can’t control,  
panels lit by organs: heart’s glow,  
deep sparkle of lung cavity,  
steady pump of intestine.

Creatures creeping at night, reshaping me into being.
