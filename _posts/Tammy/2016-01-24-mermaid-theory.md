perfection lies pollute minds  
dietary slip eats up insides  
skip meals  
trip heels  
hike up that skirt  
they’ll kneel  
they’ll kneel  
know your queen  
she’s the fem-enemy  
who makes a beeline  
for the best of me  
tear it up  
looking down  
her royal highness  
airbrushed, but hush  
it’s too much  
beauty unmatched  
she hatched  
[goddess]  
from the ocean  
she could be your friend  
for a price  
’cause she can turn an army  
to mice  
coyly unmanned  
aloof and unplanned  
her manicured hand fans  
the fires that she  
lit when the powers that be  
questioned her sincerity  
approach, but step warily  
coming too near will doom you to roam  
the outskirts of her Eden alone  
she can smell the fear under your cologne  
you don’t trust, but you must  
you only doubt ’cause you lust  
grain by grain, time slips  
through hourglass hips  
and every grin on her lips  
cracks like a whip  
slave to her, who craves to lure  
sailors off-ship  
engulfed by the tide, eyes glide  
over porcelain skin  
the same bait  
that drove Adam to sin  
the price of her prowess  
shown by the emotional mess  
of a drunken master:  
her heart is a natural disaster.
