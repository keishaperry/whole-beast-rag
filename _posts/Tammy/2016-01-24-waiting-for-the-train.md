I am watching falling leaves disentegrating into black bile beneath my feet  
tiny horde of black bile people breathing out hate spores   
into the world and watching them pass and fall away  
their furling coil around the living and born slowly fall away  
their furling fires that were living inside us fall away  
take me to the top of the agrocrag  
this train is on the surface of the sun  
our bodies are sugar glass  
we are running express to bryn mawr  
all bacchae please exit the train now  
you can’t buy alcohol without the wristband  
GET YOUR WRISTBAND  
we are falling up and down  
we are the surface of the moon  
we are learning our bodies are the substance of sound  
we are blue and made from blue and rain and accidental grace  
we are gorgeous and nothing and falling on our face  
this train is on the surface of the sun  
perfection beyond the coming breath of understanding  
we are the droplets of understanding  
we are it’s cycle of creation and death  
we are the present in the closet of existence  
waiting for the
