god’s not the only one  
who invited us to party

casablanca  
romanian paul  
pol pot  
those wet apocalips  
the stalin car

who knows at what the cow lows & mews  
the grass isn’t sweetening the winedark dawn isn’t  
vintage

more of a rosé color or the hue of bubbly  
from a glass the universe is still beginning  
vantage

more than anything in the world i used to  
light the cigarette & get gassed  
without a warrant  
in my blood

in my blood a huddle of ashkenazis  
crossed into other nights  
crossed out

madrid hi  
london  
(heathrow)
