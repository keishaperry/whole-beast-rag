wrote you a note on the back of your hand  
oh gentle gentle memo pad hands  
my dream  
circle be my circle come around and around with me  
make sick little boy jump in the sky  
ghost of the planet neptune humming out the gourd  
living loving caressing the void  
half ghost encased in forever noise  
sing songs of glorious hurdle jumps  
thank you taco carrot beet juice  
telephone pole dancing monkeys clutching hand cymbals  
portable music box cutter lover  
paper mâché cream hands I am eyeing like the peace I’ve been wanting  
since the beginning of my lonesome years  
I can rain out from the corners and pour myself a new cup of laundry  
the tide pull out of boulders  
creaky floorboard old fashioned noose twisting around new fangled necks  
you have to hit the truth  
live and die/crawl in your skin  
plant all the seeds of all the most beautiful dreams  
my fingers are pulling them closer when my hand is scratching the table  
I will pet ghost table long after my nails have chipped away every trace of wood  
I am going to cut up tiny circle-sized pictures of us and put them on a giant-sized wall-sized poster because you are so beautiful and we are small.  
I am going to hug all babies with ashes in their eyes  
these rivers and streams are like other river and streams but these are made of tiny tar people.  
I love you because this feels like cobweb heaven.  
I love you because we are all made of shredded contents of sort-of interesting legal documents.  
Teleport all the mountains into the ocean so when we fall into the sea the last time, so it  
won’t be as much of an environmental adjustment as it is a pesky gill development.  
Iowa avenue  
living snouts of screaming joy fall throw from their cases  
falling all over the pavement with their screaming air violently pushing holes.  
Bat lakes flying over us grape lines  
phone lines sine fire  
I hope you are bound, my tiny ocean fingers of everlasting love  
OUR LOVE GEOMETRIC SHIMMERS OF THE SUN OVER THE DEPARTING YEAR  
I WOULD LIKE TO LIVE FOREVER HERE
