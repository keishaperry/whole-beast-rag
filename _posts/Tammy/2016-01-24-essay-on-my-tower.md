**The abject has only one quality of the object—that of being opposed by it.** —Julie Kristeva, _Powers of Horror_

**I’m in the milk and the milk’s in me.** —Maurice Sendak, _Mickey in the Night Kitchen_

My small awakening pearls in a bell  
amidst the windblown birdsong  
and bats touristing the tower  
where I nest in late grandmothers’  
hairstrands and rosepetals. I often press  
my self against the column: all the water,  
my body’s spectral crashing waves underskirt.  
Or the more birdlike comportment  
of zero traumas ever. Or is this a well.  
I conjure extra instinct in the higher air.  
Animals transit the rotunda, moths  
venture here to whiten and die.  
This must be real, then. I can’t stop  
touching the shape. At the head  
of the cylinder. Seated at the right  
hand of the Head of the Table.  
My small glass thought divined  
from the bottom of my nakedness.  
If I ever could touch and feel it.  
I’m in the cock and the cock’s in me.  
As if my inner violet finally opened  
with Mars as its ruling planet. As a tower  
about war. Between structure and lightning,  
the god in the details of pure air  
and the bruise I believed to be true.  
Bruise-colored tissue eclipsing  
the solar heart of me—the core  
of this traumatic need for infinite  
contact with pure surgeon tower dazzle.  
My tower-spectacular me straddling  
bearclaw and speculation. Cave goddess  
and risky behavior. As if my inner mouth  
can’t stop rooting for the primal colossus—  
the pure and vigorous heart—of my tower  
of towering father at the bottom of every well.
