![beautiful](/assets/img/tammy/scarboro/beautiful.png)
<div class="artist-caption" markdown="1">
_Beautiful_  
Whisk me from my boring little island and deliver me to a world of glamour, high-fashion all-night champagne parties, and wealth.
</div>

<div class="artist-caption" markdown="1">
_Blonde_  
I would run from this room right now, find a tree, and string Barbie up.
</div>

![bothness](/assets/img/tammy/scarboro/bothness.jpg)
<div class="artist-caption" markdown="1">
_Bothness_  
Find genius in the opposing position, privileging the complex messiness of the both over the simplistic clarity of the either/or.
</div>

<div class="artist-caption" markdown="1">
_I Put This on for You Now Come and Take It Off_  
We are told nothing of the woman's appearance, she is revealed only through her ornaments.
</div>

![kant](/assets/img/tammy/scarboro/kant.jpg)
<div class="artist-caption" markdown="1">
_Kant_  
That landscape, that whole terror of the icy slope.
</div>

![marionette](/assets/img/tammy/scarboro/marionette.png)
<div class="artist-caption" markdown="1">
_Marionette_  
She turns to me with malevolent red eyes. They glitter blankly and something is wrong with her hands. I realize, watching, that she is controlled by wires pulling her fingers along the keys.
</div>

![ontologicalq1](/assets/img/tammy/scarboro/ontological1.jpg)
<div class="artist-caption" markdown="1">
_Ontological Question 1_  
Death by gun shot, cancer, car crash, in your bed; it's all ultimately cardiopulmonary arrest: The heart stops beating, oxygen can no longer reach the brain and that's it, you're dead. Always the same death.
</div>

![ontologicalq2](/assets/img/tammy/scarboro/ontological2.png)
<div class="artist-caption" markdown="1">
_Ontological Question 2_  
In a shadow we are equalized, all the same color, all with a mutable form that shifts with light, dense to translucent, stretched to compressed, thin to wide.
</div>

![witch](/assets/img/tammy/scarboro/witch.jpg)
<div class="artist-caption" markdown="1">
_Witch_  
The witch is an alluring vision who uses her loveliness to enchant, or she is an ugly and fearsome being who may transform into a nocturnal beast or disappear to lurk, invisible but watching.
</div>
