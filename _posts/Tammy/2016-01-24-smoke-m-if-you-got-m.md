my eternal sister  
my profound cancer

is a medical conspiracy  
how you write the name matters  
check the variations against aggressively

we come in too many ideas  
and not enough self  
to fuck them  
all the way they deserve  
to be done

the shape of the bolt

being changed  
always deliberately  
a proprietary interest  
in wrench sales

this is a bad business model  
this is bright lights in dead water  
if you let them pronounce  
you you kill the sky  
youâ€™re standing in
