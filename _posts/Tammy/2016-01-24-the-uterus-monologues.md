_Knock Knock._

_Whoâ€™s there?_

Likes: Spending time with friends (stomach and liver), the fetal position, and lead smocks used for dental x-rays. Dislikes: sharp objects, radiation, and scooping the litterbox.

Advertisement for Self-Concious Uteruses: birth-control pills and (anti) menopause pills look exactly alike! Aside: They also look quite similar to Smints which is maybe why no one buys Smints anymore.
