write from the perspective of a column on a spreadsheet  
write from the perspective of a column on a spreadsheet that rebels right out of your computer to  
organize your life in the most insignificant way possible  
write from the perspective of a grumpy train conductor in the 1970s who falls in love with a red-  
haired woman with two children  
write from the perspective of a drowning girl who is being drowned by her lover  
write from the bird on the top of the gas chamber  
write from the perspective of an internet meme  
write from the perspective of a ghost that people enjoy having around  
write from the perspective of the beard of a man who is snuggling in the breasts and stomach of a  
woman he loves  
write from the perspective of a mother who is watching her child falling in the street  
write from the perspective of a mother watching her child fall to the ground while there are bullets riddling his skin  
write from the perspective of the fire hydrant that is watching it all from a distance across the way write from the perspective of the little girl who loves the little boy  
write from the perspective of the little girl who loves the little boy because she was supposed to grow old with him and how she must think all the things that were supposed to be fate and how it  
all falls into silent reconsideration and probably will remain stuck there  
write all the little pieces of your soul that have been left out in the cold, have been left stuck in all the most traumatic moments of this life and before. tell them to me, all one by one and then tell  
me what you would say when you reached to take them back  
what do you say when you bring your soul back  
what do you say to a broken heart when the breaks are untouchable  
write from the perspective of silence  
always write from the perspective of the voice of silence
