I mean the death drive that lurks  
Malibu all over  
Puts in full sway the palms of love.

Let us query one more text about the sea  
It’s borderline as smart  
As rain yesterday tomorrow sarsen.

The whales pray to Dionysus  
Sarsen on her face was so good  
So sorry

The orgy at the party was so Dionysian  
The people still waving goodbye, goodbye  
& Lorelei at the window  
At the window full of light

When a face becomes a whale song sarsen  
It’s good to be blind.  
It looks good to be blind  
With a collie goading the way  
& nothing wincing.  
I mean the death drives in a PT Cruiser

The lovers in an outside-Paris suburb  
just outside Paris in the promenade  
it is so much juster outside Paris  
Stump one another in the car

Who planted olive branches on her stumps  
With duct tape on the blood in the Century  
Seven or something maybe just outside Par  
is as rain yesterday tomorrow severs ices se

vers lovers  
Divers lovers  
Fucked 300 people  
The crotch carts 300 people  
Pull from my hand the ocean coffin  
Lorelei’s rot a whale bloats tonight the window sarsen

Hair’s son  
Let down your trusses.  
A golden shower of ducats  
Let down your dead.  
Let us query one more text about the sea  
I mean the death drive that jerks  
Piss out your dead.  
Bring out your piss out your dead.
