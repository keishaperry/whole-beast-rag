the cells die unrecorded  
around the stress you put on a name

_Conception ingénieuse_. like

if you put the stupid thoughts end to end to end  
they will make a sentence

whatever works girls

just _always_® do it with confidence

_Let your style shine!_ like

place the needles end to end  
and spin them

you will come out deflowered  
and _incredibly_ Thin™
