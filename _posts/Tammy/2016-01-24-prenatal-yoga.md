I. Savasana | Corpse Pose  
Bulbed women glisten.  
Sweet balloons, static cling,  
to the center. We haven’t realized  
how malleable we can be.  
There is warrior into goddess.  
Little creeks swaying  
down our backs. The room is full  
of puffed breath, full blow  
of anticipation lingering,  
pressing against one another.  
We become fallen pine, fronds  
and sticky sap, sinking.  
I imagine the full blush of an orange,  
navel widening, peeling the skin  
to reveal a glowing sphere.

II. Uttanasana | Standing Forward Bend  
Widening women ache.  
Outside, thick autumn clouds,  
rain drawing night. Brows furrow,  
windshield wiping sweat, our arms  
and digits swinging into place, black bears  
with distended bellies, mat slipping.  
Abdomens sway open, overripe blisters.  
One woman has missed her due date  
by miles, her gravity closer to Styx.  
I cannot—these two words pulsing  
beneath my heart bones, black splotches  
before my eyes, not just rain clouds.  
Here the windowsill mocks me—  
I could just lean into it, sweaty hand  
mirroring sweaty hand, topple through  
into the night, bare branches,  
slick pavement, splotch and blister burst.

III. Balasana | Child’s Pose  
At the gates of my hips, you are tumbling, resting.  
Tumbling, resting. Slight propel of legs  
on the ultrasound screen, your knees  
knobbing, pumping, breathing in and out  
of the folds of uterus, and we search  
for something we already know—  
we call it bicycling. But you are at will,  
freely stirring amniotic detritus,  
you are that willow across the pond,  
whose fronds bicycle the autumn air.
