</div>  

The series is to resemble a photo-set that might accompany an article in a modern women's magazine showcasing young, attractive, alternative women who have chosen to modify their bodies, and in some cases, sacrifice a vital appendage in the mix. A grotesque fetish viewed through the compelling lens of extra-normal feats and modern diversity, masking the detrimental priority of fashion, which has grown to consume flesh in new, and dramatic ways.  

The connection with the body is a talking point that seems to be lost on many, lost in the day-to-day shuffle of surviving. As humanity continues to change, to keep up with our technological tower of Babel, we will no doubt be challenged to make decisions based on questions to which the answers will constantly be changing as well.  

This is but a glance at one of those questions: How will the fashion (and culture) industry respond to digital evolution of (wo)man?
