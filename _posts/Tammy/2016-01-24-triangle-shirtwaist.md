Women who escaped for a promise. One even gave Vesuvius the slip.

Veer off to Greenwich Village. Grate ticks by,  
tinder freight. A plum. A calm. Sheer the ferry’s waist.

Needle prance, your empty pocket. Subject to rhythms  
of the machine. Foreman’s rubber-tipped sneak a peek.

Those thread-cones, make them faster. Mistakes meant hunger.  
You know. So he locks the door. So he can look inside.

Ribbons as fat as hats, guild a key. Whispers among the machines.  
Clara had six broken ribs when she said strike. _We all stood up and  
walked out_. Whores can be hired too, thumb a nose.

Mink brigades meant safety nests, those coppers showed  
clubbing caution. _Those brave girls_. Beckon back.  
No union in the ash building.

Tip a cigarette, waft and then, that flame dawdles.  
Death’s slow tease. Crush a boulevard. The building’s spindles  
cast in an alleyway. _We watched them burn_. Falling and fall-out.

Ribbons of flame. _We still had to play the hoses upon them_.  
Narrow nose of fire.

The women were swatched in white, put in troughs.  
The women were waiting to be told where to go.

_I’ve looked for her, I cannot tell._  
The face of a woman no longer a woman.  
_I knew her by her hair; I had braided it for her that morning._
