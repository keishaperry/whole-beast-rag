The first fuck is the deepest  
The first fuck is the best fuck  
The hole room breaks & falls  
the objects break away and fall  
fall away always  
the hot horsehair moons

All the animals die & become  
Animals make sense this time  
We all become senses  
The room leaks demiserebirth  
Perhaps a plumber’s in order

The next day we order a plumber.  
Expedited delivery is leaking  
There are dove hairs everywhere  
It is miserable  
Or it is pigeon hairs & ocean oil  
I put olive oil in it after the first  
Fuck the deepest forever  
Reminds of times I don’t remember

The way the man distracts me stares  
A remembered object fucks me  
While we are out of it  
out of myself & into the other  
The first fuck impulses  
Imply a concentration  
Heigh ho! Voila!  
Your name yells into the bed

I remember into the bed  
The first fuck brands  
You like a cow  
I forget  
You are really quite a woman  
Nike

You slashed victory over my head why didn’t you tell me  
Sensei  
Yell into the bed  
Your name cells into the bed  
We leave the bed outside the coffin awhile  
We fuck & the final burial is  
Distracting  
A coughing fit of blacks  
Sudden blank butterflies  
Dig the whole thing the coffin  
Bedpan for the living but the dead pain  
Bed is for living

Final budding pleasure place  
Again  
What’s your number again  
I mean the tattoo in the place  
To mark you I mean the tattoo  
Rhymes with armed against the demons  
In the tampon the Aurora Borealis  
Taboo

Love is Real
