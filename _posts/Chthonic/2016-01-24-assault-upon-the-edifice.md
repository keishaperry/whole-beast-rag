passive aggression  
permeates folds of  
thick winter clothes  
surrounding every  
inch of tightened skin  
while the struggle to be real  
has become an impasse  
verging on psychological  
subjugation  

so that some will suffer  
for lacking fraudulence  
with many forthright  
travelers taken as  
an assault upon  
the edifice of  
this countyâ€™s  
subdued  
citizenry  

as each  
unspoken  
word suffocates  
on the edge of an  
incomprehensible  
blunder
