Man-without-a-desk  
Wanders the high plains of  
Human history  

Grandfather of us all  
Ur-figure with a straight spine  
He sits in the tall grass  
And waits for the moon  
He thinks we have forgotten him  
And in many ways  
We have  

We forgot when it was his birthday  
And the books that we borrowed from him  

But he can still see us  
Every time lightning  
Flashes across the sky
