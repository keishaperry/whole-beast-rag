2/4’s Ginseng and red bull  
splashed blackberry vodka  

blunt wraps filled w/  
crumbled kush,  

we are rubberized  
seafoam animals,  

waterswolled and  
crayed out of our minds. 

The divo records himself on TiVo  
to masturbate to his beauty.  

There’s an underground lookbook  
floating on a limp whisper,  

or something about fresh meat,  
Emporium of deerface, I told you  

we are exquisitely messed up.  
I’ve been liked to death,  

somersaulted  
called For A Good Time—  

I’m sorry the time wasn’t  
average my current net worth  

exceeds a trip to a German sexroom,  
meaning, your [sic]  

uncomfortably glad to be here.  
Being alive is kind of a reality fuck.
