I self-medicated for 10 minutes  
on the floor, waiting for a reason  
to tell you that I grew up listening  
like a material girl, like an empty  
flower vase filled with deer urine.  
What I really wanted to say before  
was that I loved you like an adjunct  
mathematics professor loves to smear  
the marker on the overhead projector.  
I was exhausted by your restraint.  
When I talked about addiction at first,  
that night—I was referring to how  
nothing is an addiction until you suck  
cock for it. About how God is second  
on my list labeled food chain and how  
I really felt. The summer I was haulin’  
mulch. The summer I planted lime green  
ferns around cobalt signs sighing the last  
sigh of the American worker. The summer  
I once wanted to relive ended in a house fire.
