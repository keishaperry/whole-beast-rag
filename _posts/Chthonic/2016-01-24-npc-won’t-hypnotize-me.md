Wise move, NPC, truculent  
twitch beyond screen. I slow-open  
shade drawn windows and breathe in the dog shit.  
This is progress, the zone,  
itemized the soft bits between legs and felt guilty  
hours later when big bang static comes in free. 

Opened my mouth  
to get a web, to slide it  
down my throat. I won’t press play  
until beeps allow me.  
Across the street, exposed  
power lines in an abandoned house  
about-face my exposed body,  
air from underneath leaky floorboards,  
low hum of generator building toward excess.  
When it comes back on  
unplug me.  

Merchandize! NPC won’t hypnotize me.  
Lay it out flat, side by side,  
hems one way, zippers another.  
Lay it out flat and sell me back my sleaze.

oh-zone, o no,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it’s goosey out here for a trucker, 

bridge too low for my big rig’s hat rack  

which is a boil&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if I ever seen one


Through talk channels  
Voice chat, over game  
Distorted, too quiet, overplayed  
By other voices  
While action sound continues  
The chat, the shot  
Clicks until it resets  
NPCs abound, shift team to team  
I wet mic stub, mic end  
Whisper static grind into nubs  
While they mute, unmute  
Let new voices enter  
The game-space, leaks  
Into other space, rain outside  
Air condition grinds on  
While voices click  
In and out, through headphone  
Through stream noise  
Through heavy breathing noise  
I express myself in comments  
With teeth pressed tight against keys  
Style won’t leave you out  
Even if you let it
