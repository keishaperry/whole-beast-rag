You don’t use the fancy soaps near the ornate faucet  

you don’t use the fluffy towel on the rack  

You pull the ones out from below the sink,  

that’s why we keep them there,  

remember?  

A warm closet of clothes, it’s where you keep your suitcase  

no one wears jackets here  

bikinis and flip-flops- something secret and at-home about it  

your father was dying since the day you met him  

he told you every day that he hoped he lived long enough to  

watch your son play tee-ball  

You know where to find it, the door  

meant for leaving  

home is where you keep it  

but you wouldn’t dare make a mess
