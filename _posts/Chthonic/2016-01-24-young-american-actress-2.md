Dracula teeth,  

scary faces  

Nas _You Can Hate Me Now_  

Kabuki  

Frank Sinatra  

alone in a room  

w/ a red phone, pow  

now it’s a party  

The hero’s antithesis  

has developed a serum  

to bring the dead,  

I’m supposed to betray him  

once in the first act  

& again in the second  

Being so evil never felt  

so arbitrary  

There’s a gunshot  

for every good deed  

is the tagline I live  

Believe it for no other reason  

than I’ve repeated it  

while nibbling on their  

most expensive bread
