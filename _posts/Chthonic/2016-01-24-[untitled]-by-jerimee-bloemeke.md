I sleep as the noise has stopped beginning  
Within the warning on the warning label  
Attached to the cord,  
Within the shadow of the warning label  
Attached to the cord,  
Within the shadow of the cord  
Within the shadows on the wall, the tree’s shadow  
Swaying on the wall, the tree shadowing the pickets,  
The pickets’ shadows shadowing piked  
Portions of the building’s brick wall.

It is in these shadows I sleep  
Everywhere where there are vehicles, engineer’s  
boots,  
Plastic bags, a pedestrian, anonymous, anonymous  
In an almost anonymous where-about, a location, mapped,  

Where lights cast shadows beyond glass. Beyond glass  
I am beyond light. I stand beyond a door  
I know to be unlocked, aware of the pedestrian  
With its small, anonymous square of light  
And its almost anonymous map location;  
Aware of the constellations the pedestrian sees  
As stars who are as aware of me as they are aware  
Of the noise I hear them make; aware of no switch  
Which can stop the noises beginning  
Which are about to go unheard.
