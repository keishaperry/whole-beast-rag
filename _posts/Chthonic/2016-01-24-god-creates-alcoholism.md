Spilled brandy was seeping through  
the cloud-colored carpeting and I didn’t  

have a paper towel. The alcohol fell  
through to the human world and infected  

their blood like animal waste in the Nile.  
On that day, the skin of my creations sang  

horrible lyrics toward me after the sun  
set for the night. On that day, the teeth inside  

their mouths were left grasping for any kind  
of air, like a man who couldn’t swim. For several  

thousand years, the humans had been  
hiding their weakness behind a hollowed-out  

Bible on the fifth shelf. I had been hiding  
yet-another-mistake while also carrying a spare  

handkerchief to prevent anything worse—  
to prevent a smoother vice from entering my garden.
