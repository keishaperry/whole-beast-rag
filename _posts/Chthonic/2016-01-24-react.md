All mannerisms drift up to the Himalayas  
Look! there goes solitude hand in hand with  
fickle, vanity on her back suckling one  
disembodied erect nipple: brown sun-bleached contrasts warm.  
Ego pulls a cart of indulgence,  
whipped for his efforts,  
scars stripe the backs of his knees, or is it hers?  
under its skirt I find only promises.  

I am drawn to the rapid cavity in my chest  
soft black glowing shards of glass cut my hands  
but I plunge deeper, blood hardens full of taste  
I am up to the elbow. .past  
Next comes the torso slipping easily  
without lubrication,  
shudders.  
I pull my legs through and my hips, lastly  
folding it all shut, tying a bow,  
A gift for me  
An unbeing  
Disrobed at last I am free.  

Directions for a wholesome nonexistence:  

1\. burrow under the mtn  

2\. accumulate nothingness  

3\. dissipate
