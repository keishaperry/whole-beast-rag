If you decide to sit at home thinking about the episode of _True Life_ where the guy gets calf implants—  

Turn to page \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  

If you turn out like your mother- ironing wrapping paper after birthday parties-  

See below:  

Simple vows of easy come easy go  
they opened their mouths  
confetti came out  

then your father moved away from the city,  
room and board at a Volvo dealership,  
taking sink showers in the staff bathroom,  
vending machine meals of reduced-fat Wheat Thins and Diet Coke  

at least that’s what you figured when he didn’t come home  

Unsure if you were to blame for the neighbor’s flooded house when you left the sprinklers on,  
unsure if the house fire was caused by your compost pile  

keep it quiet like the summer your brother dropped _Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire_ on top of 
your little brown lizard  

savage glitter  

a rheumy house haunted by doubt  

paid to lose  

night in, night out  

I remember where I am when it’s time to go  

and it’s been four days since you’ve made your own bed  

Would you rather drown or be burned alive?
