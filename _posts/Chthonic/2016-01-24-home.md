No home hides that snake,  
Crawling up to my finger.  
He is not wel -bred.  
He limps through black waters,  
He licks all the poisonous plants.  
His stomach is hollow.  
Moon-full, moon-hungry,  
I want to feel his slenderness in my arms.  
Upholstered with dead sockets,  
Limp as a fish.  
But he is not.  
A fish, or a black-veiled worm.  
He is the widow,  
The egg-headed monarch, the virgin at childbirth.  
He strokes my hair, gross-feeding charmer.  
He burns, and lifts me up to a craving wake.
