A girl shaped like a bear. A bear-shaped girl.  
A girl inside the maw of a bear. A girl with a breath like a roar.  
A roar beneath me. Wel -trained. Shields and pistons.  
A wet field. Cupped hands in a fountain.  
The chill that travels there. Bones like a dancer.  
Skittering. A pelted promise. Wearing my pelt.  
Dance by a fire pit. A girl shaped like a girl.
