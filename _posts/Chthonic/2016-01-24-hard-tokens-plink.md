cold like quarters in the seed  
how apples make friends  
with what they fall into—hand or land  

firm headed creature commune  
skills the crane lost in flight  
its uppermost parts pull apart  

to lift the bottom of a building  
vertical compartments in the skinny parts  

a wind no window gathers  
the strings on a foreign capital  
play songs none remember  

but the players sway and whirl into instruments  
of the state—forget your health  
insured with a staple gun and placard  

what it means to slave your intestines, intention  

see no whiskey on the bottle  
just the rings for a cap  
adjust the volume with tapwater  
smiling your teeth to shine  

glad to meet you handshake  

formal attire licked into shape  
the crust is upper and utmost  
but the servers don’t shed no language  

what tricks employed to forget  
a constant disabling  

the goals and holes to file and till  
sheet snag sheets full of scratching  
a whopping pile of stars  

die in each blink  
they’re not as sable as us  
dipping our untied mouths  

the unity of rapture  
it’s high time we’ve cuttlefished  
and inked up another  
sopping wet letter  

to eat the next plague  
in each tearstain  
to wait for the suburban lawn  
burning each sunseason down  

the long looks of the neighbors  
on our faces  
strange into strangled  
a flapping shout made home  

if it’s a car, they say, it’s only  
exploding for a minute  
and all the children lean  
into their drive away  

set their heads retired  
with a wick  
and flower  
tilt on the stem 

sugar mates coat to tongue  
the forward facing parts  
blister in the sun  
like steamlights through film  

watch you tough, shut touch  
out while the whole field  
dots with bugs—curtain  
of live things for a day swat  

sounds get tiny in each of us  
through cans knocking along  
behind the vehicle  
wheels and horns and waves  

so long liquidy heels  
hours soaring on the walk  
being and written in the same  
gesture—milk on the ground  

edicts won’t bait terse monsters  
spray the regulars down  
or at least their chairs  
so no one knows which scent  

to sit next to the mirror  
in a way that makes the body  
split and double—once my lips  
stuck fast to the court of your yard
