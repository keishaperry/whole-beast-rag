_You wouldn’t believe it here_  

Hi, welcome to Subway  

Hi, welcome to Subway  

Hi, welcome to Subway Hi, welcome to Subway  

mynah birds consumed by their artistry, none of them look up  

_Yesterday working in the village, the guerrillas attacked and this house burst apart right in front of_  

I’ll have a foot long turkey on flatbread, toasted  

Provolone, please  

[This is something that should be read at home]  

_But we’re all okay thankfully. I feel that any doubt I had can be validated by our_

And to the military escort man, I’d probably tell him that at a certain point you forget the ache, the stiffness of being still.]  

Friends in this town are settling  

down, I’m in  

a bad way to do the same
