1.

we’re staring down  
we’re done  
the map—Virginia  
traffic, the listing sea  
of parenthood.  
our periods  
are legion—  
the legion is full  
of old men farting  
and sweat-cheap drinks.  
I don’t own my suit, a seat  
inside, three fingers  
of simple pressure  
applied beneath  
the eyelids in a tilt-backed  
chair. they say  
it’s safe  
to drive right through here.

2.

why has every person  
who’s ever been  
in the seat I’m to sit in  
on a plane before me  
the same exact size I am?  
I’ve never once  
adjusted the belt  
to fit my hips.  
it’s already set  
to my width.

3.

I worry the edges of my pants, the crotch  
always blows out eventually, too, and I don’t  
listen to the safety talk.  
Heart crashes in my head  
enough to close my eyes. No serial #s  
in my dreams Mark Hamill  
gets blowjobs from invisible everyone  
& the oxygen masks  
don’t come down  
when they should  
we land with a lift & tilt  
of wing & I whisper to you  
as you complete your outfits—  
your shoes perfectly coordinated,  
the sleep staff simple  
as the waking kind.

4.

A man leans in to his traveling friends  
and learns how to pop his ears  
by holding his nostrils closed  
and blowing—  
how to log into the sky. A child  
dog noises and we are confused.  
There’s a dog.  
The engine’s press for launch.  
We are up & banking  
snakes of light—the highway’s  
slow & lovered  
heart pressed forward rush  
when the engines dip  
into a flare of metal sound  
then quiet.  
Dog child light on the wing & so much  
for what to do in the dark

5.

This week I’ve got a hungry mouth and the body to prove it.

6.

A symbol on the dais, the waitressed sky says careful.  
I’m drinking a coke and eating the tiny pretzels.  
Question games play over and over & no, there’s  
nothing for  
the tequila of individualism—we’re supposed to arrive  
early in this tin bolt. All of our bodies produce flammable  
gas and here we are, never lighting any of it.

7.

My eyes don’t have any problems either  
aside from being unable to see.

8.

The cat gut stretching  
a pie piece—you say the answer  
and get it, move your circle  
round the board. New question  
shines up against the platform  
& another copy  
cat sets the sights—please me, please  
yourself, please me again, then you  
& in that order

no one belts the wiser purring engine  
lost of its central churn and charge.

9.

To get the flywheel: to dive the pistol  
home without the depressing hammer.

10.

viewers now must borrow someone  
else’s hand to press the change  
channel button & their entire lives  
become unglued  
the cushioned  
couch beneath them

11.

overheard:  
she did go on a log flume  
the largest temper tantrum  
I’ve texted  
the strikeout move

12.

To navigate a city by its bars—the windowed  
ones, the ones to get drunk in, the policed  
stationed  
after-effects of many pale afternoons  
clusterfucked together. The bit you battle with  
is better than the battle you bait with.
