“You would have really liked it,  
What happened to us last night.”  

Dangling feet shaking to hatred  
They see the see thru pane  
Purchased all around them  
In deliberate quarters; track lit, envision  
Who is watching who cannot be seen; live  
Poor to talk about it in stinging drafts.  
Particles of graphite in the air their eyes began to watch  
A four-hour long yesterday.  

They ran yesterday never seen. A black shelf leans.  
Nothing hangs from looks like ceiling strings  
The usage of landscaping in a living room  
And does not say words or anything to them  
And is the only pleasure the past two days  
Their debit was down.  
The phone checks.  

They were not there, no one was  
At Dodge getting dark, the Hilltop pool, beginning  
To storm a five star number like always reflecting  
Off windows across the street because the sunset  
Last week…the sun off a shattered second floor window.  
A musician, piling rolls of sorority carpet onto the roof of  
An Escort station wagon, paid one dollar for help, six bucks  
In a field at sunset yesterday. A cornfield video shoot; “easy dreams”  
Knew dreams to ruin it back to Dodge, the porch, the  
Computer, the organ, smashed bookshelf on the deck  
& five or so burned in the fire pit.  

Smoke slid through crevices.  
An aeronautics appeared. The note:  
_Thank you for [the] every thing_

Not a given “the everything” to someone else in the way  
Is the enormous bliss of the American death.  
The mattress on another porch the saving of caps  
On the microwave. The diagnostics only mean what they have meant  
For so long. Against a brick wall in a parking lot, drunk  
On pills, three cigarettes behind one ear, pulling leaves  
Off bushes, picking flowers out of people’s beds (bouquet fists)  
And chipping church pew finish to pick a thorn out of a thumb  
With scratched legs, the boom man records fake conversations too far away.
