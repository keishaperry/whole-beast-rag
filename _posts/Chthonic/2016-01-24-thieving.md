Can never be certain  
what sheâ€™s feeling

even when her mouth  
opens  
old thoughts  
like treasure.

I wonder if I am  
greedy.

Share greedily,  
speak greedily,  
hear greedily.

You can only  
give her so much

before she starts to feel  
full  
and  
robbed of herself.
