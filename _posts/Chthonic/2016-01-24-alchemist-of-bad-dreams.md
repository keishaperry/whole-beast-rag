Asleep when it happened, I lived for the  
5D of the equinox, of the three orbs  
In space like dark, reverse engineered  
Construction paper lining an urn.

The Sun, Earth & its moon closely align  
& Crash, like too many open windows,  
Together in a flash of glass reflected  
Light thru a bedroom window at night.

And when I awoke in media res Pink Floyd  
Was on Music Choice, the quartz pyramid  
From their longtime bestselling album cover  
Refracted a rainbow on this girl’s T-shirt.

And it dawned on me to let her know  
The trifecta the medieval couldn’t imagine  
Was superimposed over my retinae  
& That I would never forget that

I am an alchemist of bad dreams,  
I have a eyeball in my eye socket,  
But I told her that this makes sense  
In earnest, water on the dark side of the moon.

_Manmade desert of white; parcel_  

~SHARD~

Ikea EXPEDIT shelving edges  
Permeate wisps or like the edges  
Of horizon mirages, e.g. _high gloss_  
_Surfaces reflect light and give a vibrant look._  

Like faint, classic rock  
Or the mini laptop marble  
Is the feeling of disparate genres  
Or the feeling of these object edges  
That color the periphery  
With a visionary ink gone dry

The warehouse exclaims its silence.  
The warehouse titles itself  
WE BUY HOUSES & BUILDINGS.  
The warehouse subtitles itself  
The Scare of the Wait

Afraid not to move like me  
I am ever the guest of my host.  
Some parasitic overnighter  
With his teeth ensconced  
In metaphysical necks  
With his drinking and taking shits  
Indoors ‘til his host’s off at six  
Like a one/third devil time

Like lingering amounts of hours  
With X eating yoga franks  
Contemplating subway stop Koran ads  
Obliquely defending 9/11  
Remembering what’s underneath  
The pullout and tiger hide duvet.  
Sober complaints, truth be told.  
Much less, one is passing out hard

Tearing his Joe Boxers to shreds  
Dabbing jizz with paper towel hearts  
As if the unborn millions require love (however shaped)  
The same way the billion born do.  
The same way it can be seen on her face.  
Her expression as it is wiped off  
By another generation into deletion

By that civilization into cynical irony (!  
Hating me because I am with two blondes  
Not because I danced with one of them sloppy  
Or spilled my white ‘til I was ejected  
With the one who says no when asked.  
The one who says something else  
Says we will never be like that.  
_It’s too late for us that used to be us._  
12-storey paintings of inexplicable forms  
Primarily torn from youth  
Like disinterested cacti  
In ski masks flexing biceps  
Applying to ourselves  
Purple Sephora lip-gloss.  
We have seen us do that.  
“I have seen myself do this.”
