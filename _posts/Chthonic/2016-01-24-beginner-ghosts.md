Confetti cannon  

mouth,  
candy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s&nbsp;&nbsp;p&nbsp; r&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y &nbsp;!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; !!!  

trick  
or treaters  
hit by an errant driver  

I shiver  

beginner ghosts  
going firecracker deaf  

jackrabbit jumpy at the kitchen table,  
divorced parents,  
fourth and one, it’s a handoff  
which twin is which, I can’t tell the difference anymore  

Someone pulled the fire alarm  
during gym class in the cafeteria,  
later someone cut the phone lines,  
then toilet paper took over the trees  

The duchess has been kidnapped!  
you’re little like a prince,  
But the motif has  
been ruined!  
one of your friends came dressed as  
a Harlem Globetrotter  

busy as a beekeeper  
making excuses why you smoke like  
a miner  

In search of a weekend tradition unlike  
your father’s sitting on the porch making  
sure no one steals the trash cans—  
I don’t think he ever took  
up racquetball…  

we wait for it, we wait  
we’re far too young to have become this  
boring
