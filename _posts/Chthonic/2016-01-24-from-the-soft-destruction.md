Quality of light is different in Magic Town.  

The sugar is sweeter.  

(two song pigeons watch over their grandchildren,)  

Ric Flair is immolating for us all.  

_C.R.E.A.M_.  

To be hit with an introspective blowdart, to love & love & love  

like a tiger is eating you alive.  

Nightly I cottonswab my Eustachian tube,  

& what I hear…\|  

The refrigerator shuts down;  

it eats our food.  

The sugar is sweeter.  

I don’t own that website anymore the domain is for sale,  

The engine of the spiritual modem—  

There’s a .dll for that.  

Nightly my body hums  

_Cold piece of work._  

& the sun comes up because of the dance we do.
