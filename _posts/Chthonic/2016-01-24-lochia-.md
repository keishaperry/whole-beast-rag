_Time is like basil. It will ease the sting of the  
scorpion._  

_Place it in the hands of the dead. Allow a safe  
journey. Did you place it—?_  

_I’m still bleeding. It’s been four weeks._  

_I reach down after, and all I smell are zoo-pens.  
I am the scent of a baboon’s torso. I am terrible  
to look at._  

_Span my hand. Can’t you push the rest? I feel  
the build-up like a boil. Like tremors on my  
tongue. Marbles of fat._ 

_The green blades burrow up within me. Like  
loaves of bread._  

Cooking too long will suction the flavor. Add this last.  

—in the mouth of the dying.  

It’s less blood now. You won’t know it any more.  

This is the smell of your flesh. You’ve petaled open.

It will move through.  

You breathe. You ache. 

You collect more light.
