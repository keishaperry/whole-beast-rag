I’m living in the rotted tree-  
house in the park, collapsing  
under a growing pile of leaves  
and branches. I’m here to not  
tell you that I removed your  
dog’s electric fence collar as  
an act of neighborly defiance.  
I’m here until next Thursday,  
plus one or two years. Or until  
my greening floorboards turn  
to mush and fall away, taking  
me along for the descent.  

Four Princess Di biographies  
are occupying my time, but I  
still can’t decide who had her  
killed. She’s just a collection  
of atoms now, reacquainting  
herself with the universe. Not  
much more than another check  
on the list of famous deaths  
and the list of people that wore  
something with sewn-on rhine-  
stones. I bet she also successfully  
completed multiple jigsaw puzzles.  

Everything is now a challenge.  
You would think that I would be  
satisfied with that fact, but it’s like  
settling for a used pair of dentures  
or a used treehouse. Nothing about it  
feels clean or fair. I once read that in  
every home in Switzerland there is a gun.  
This is a way for me to introduce  
my life’s beginning and end, my  
payment plan for preserving baby  
birds. Please send organic coffee  
beans and another royal biography.
