Independent when fed,  
call the shots,  
pull your own weight.

I’m your anchor drowning,

blamed for being myself.

You  
will be  
washed ashore  
four years older,  
with an older  
man, and—aspirations  
ground and  
scattered like dust—

Hourglass:  
you slip through your  
own cold fingers.
