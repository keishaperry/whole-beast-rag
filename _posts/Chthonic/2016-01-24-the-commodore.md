_“But O heart! heart! heart!”_  
—Walt Whitman_  

On a dirigible made of bones  
gaining altitude in a stranger  
ocean & suddenly &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suddenly  
embracing atmosphere it takes  
our breath away &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we shout  

Commodore where is the escalator  
we shout &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commodore we are refusing  
heaven &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shout Commodore &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where is the endless  
buffet where is the casino  

The Commodore asks for a show  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of hands  
The Commodore asks for coins  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for Charon & asks  

What does a soul  
sound like &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is it bouncing  
freely like an unexplained  
voice over the wailing loud  
speaker of a school fire drill  

The Commodore asks Who here  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is most qualified  
to drown &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& who to freeze  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who to pick apples We marvel at this  

all-you-can-eat table  
of crab legs & jello &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we marvel  
at the breadth of the whole  
fucking thing & we are  

so high up someone expresses concern  
that our skin will fall off  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;someone mentions something  
about Icarus—but this is not  
like that  

Commodore our rent’s late again  
we’re letting her get away  
Commodore &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all we have left  
to mix with the vodka  
is mouthwash & Commodore  
we are too tired  
for the stairs &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let us sleep  
here Commodore &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let us  
sleep  

The Commodore asks us to pinpoint—  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the life boat  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the oxygen mask  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the moment  
your life diverged so completely  
from itself that you became an empty  
impression  

The Commodore asks &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you ever  
lain on the ground & pretended  
you were a piece of lettuce &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commodore asks  
What will you remember  
The Commodore &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wide-eyed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;asks  
for two coins &  
The Commodore sighs slowly like blue  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like frantic pain his skin  
is stripped away &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commodore  
becomes the kind of naked  
we’ve only dreamed of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dance  
most of all The Commodore  
shouts into the feathered rest  
of everything & The Commodore goes up  
with his airship
