Oceans cross and rip open spread-legged centuries, anarchist bullets in back channel mutilations. Sin is sin as concept, art of sine mirror cosine, false agreement, mathematical minds, aggrandize tangential reckoning. We all fall apart archduke for Kaiser love, so say priests with winged intentions, soaring stones to philosophize alchemy. Scrape sky with geometries of love or subjugation, climb on blood foundations. Hearts tear easily as the rest of us.
