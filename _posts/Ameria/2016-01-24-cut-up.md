Dung funk at the motorway  
Times the massed ranking  
Squelch palpable and sucked  
In repetitive roar.  
What a sad density.  
What a redundant day  
For all the things that happen  
In the world and also not.  
Greased surgeon swoon.  
Mechanic weeping in the rifling.  
The planet grows less,  
Not more. Itâ€™s a wake-up call  
Or an anesthetic.
