PowerPoint on sucking death,  
Amputee vets dig slow crawl  


Through hot stars  
And colorful quag.  


In the talons of the eagle:  
A can of whipped cream  


And chocolate strawberries,  
A passel of spreadsheets  


En route to the fucked-up  
Quim of the corpse  


Of a billion dollars dressed up.  
To look like the White House.
