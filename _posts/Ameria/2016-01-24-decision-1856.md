When you can’t be who you are who are you? Can’t prevent what is coming, can’t sell it all under the rug to lunar colonies. Sleep forever while clouds burst around ineffectual factories and aggressive cotton gins. Thunder builds and debates your sartorial effects, what is man or mouse or love between human organisms anyway? Rising and falling, backdoor penetration lulling to complacency before asunder. Sleep well in rain-drenched openings, tree-trunks felled, beauty untroubled by moment.
