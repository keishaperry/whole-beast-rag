The secret garden that hides the fact we are all going to die. Go on the road to headlight purgatory. These are the days you can still get lost, still get in the car and arrive in another film altogether. These are the days of flying saucer noir tragedies. We knew the secret to a love story was when the filming stops. Beyond are back-alley brayings and blood olive garnish. All the blacklist blowjobs we refused to discuss. Dream of you lying dead-eyed in a flowering field, crying out: innocence.
