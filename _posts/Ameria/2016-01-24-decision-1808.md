Eyes follow movements from here to there, exploratory committees on short leashes flat-landing to the end of the rainbow. Multi-cultural refraction flows, slips, dances in and out of riverbeds panning levers. I feel them bore into me as I meet her at the café — unable to identify where pasts entwine, disentangle, reconvene. We meet where we always meet in the heart of wagon trails, one set watching as the other interprets — I merely pay the tab, a handsome tip, the smell of her hair combing fractals.
