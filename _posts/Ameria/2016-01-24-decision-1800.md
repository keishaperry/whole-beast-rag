My love is torn between co-equal branches and strong executive. My love separates church and state and throws the ring into the river, watches it ride the current and catches itself worrying about the effect of the gesture downstream. My love trembles before judicial review and habeas corpus. There are places my love has expunged wearily from the historical record, lobbied Texas textbooks to contort and remainder. My love rages with limited powers, slow drum tired beyond knowing.
