I’m honored  
by this moment  
that you’ve shared with me.  

Somewhere a dog barks  
and is quickly shot.  
We ride into the sunset.  

You ask me the difference  
between horsepower and  
torque which I just can’t  

bring myself to care about.  
I’m a horse, so I know  
exactly what I have.
