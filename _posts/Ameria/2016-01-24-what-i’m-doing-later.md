This is my wife  
a Japanese wood saw  
it’s called a dozuki.  
It reminds me of our nights  
on the park bench, playing the bozuki.  
I’m sorry that you don’t remember anything.  
The easiest way to open a banana  
is to break it clean in half.  
Pull from both ends.  
If you ask me what I’m doing later  
I’ll tell you: I’m going to saw this  
couch right in half.
