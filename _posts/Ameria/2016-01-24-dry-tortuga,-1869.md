shapeshifter, son drunk  
& changing skins.  
he digs up skeletons of a spanish battalion  
buried  
by tigers on the garden key.  


suncresent  
spray of blood & oranges.  
new-fangled sailors once soaked  
in madness.  
now starvation.  


the viking speaks:  
limericks of new world poise.  
his antler woven mask,  
set nicely upon the shore. 


seod, turtle lord  
of space & time, appears once  
every lunar eclipse, bound  
by treatise to the jellyfish triumvirate.  
his shepherd,  
bolivar t. shagnasty, wanders  
the mainland in search of water  
or meat of trees.  


kindness;  
of men turns to dust & belly worms.  
forgotten, the plants mutate  
into root-rich empires  
of fish & figurine.  
million year armistice. 


dr. samuel mudd,  
shackled years to tide-slab &  
fort jefferson. he  
purifies the island of its yellow  
shivering death.  
hospital key.  


fast forward hundred plus  
through mudd lifeline:  
battle weary sneakers,  
spokes sung by strum of card, the bmx  
stridden boy & his  


teenage mutant ninja turtle mask.
