Terrible moans  
In the solarium  
Bring the property value down.  

Too stringy viscosity  
Clot the fountains.  
Greenhouse graveyard.  

So much death for  
A second home.  
First home cloaked  
In night every night.  
What good is a guard dog  

Who thinks its people,  
Licking every flickerin  g  
Integer.
