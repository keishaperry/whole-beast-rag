Cricket song helps  
The dead become  
Comfortable  
Being dead.  
There are  
Baby faces  
In the turned-  
Up dirt. The  
Leeching wear  
Of everyone’s  
Stiff skin.  
The crisp air’s  
Brittle caress.  
The wind is  
Your favorite  
Mixtape melting.  
Go with us.  
Barrel of sparks,  
Boombox dump-  
Sters. Come  
Now. One more  
Step & it’s a  
Shallow pit  
Of red-hot  
Coals. Get fresh  
With the man  
On fire. Get  
Close to the  
Hotness. How  
Icky, the compost  
Of burning hair.  
The stickiness  
In your palm.  
Hold on, hold.  
You’re already  
Forgetting how  
Far we’ve come.  
Don’t say any-  
Thing, listen to  
Us purr the let  
Go, the unfolding.  
We’re just going  
To etch the song  
Into you—deep  
Down, all of us  
Want, at the last  
Second, to change  
What we’ve done
