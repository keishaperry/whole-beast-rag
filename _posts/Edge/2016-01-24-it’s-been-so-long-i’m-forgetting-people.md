God’s always having us touch our own rib,  
then trying to make us ashamed for it.  
I keep the forgotten pretty in my mind.  
If they ever knew my cock, I keep them gorgeous  
up there. I keep them hydrated.  
My fear stays unknown inside me.  
Still, I think of you in a 3 AM kind of way.  
I am think of you knuckles deep.  
I am think of you thinking: a car not turned  
on, my cat drinking water. His name is Rivers  
so when he drinks water, I pretend  
he’s drinking himself. I feel faulty.  
A song goes _Country restroom on the radio_  
& goddamn, when did the night leave?  
I didn’t even notice the morning stop by.  
My poems are full of pretty girls I’ll never fuck.  
Still, I believe in stoplights & amusement parks.  
I believe in pajamas. I believe we all fell out of trees  
& then slithered into the water before we climbed  
out of the water & cut the trees down.  
I just want people to smile at my face in mirrors  
I have never stood in front of.
