_for Clay B._

It just be one of those days says The Weather  
Channel, says the moon being the moon, says  
the water almost gone, says the song  
going _We about to get real unprofessional_.  
I have never worn a suit & meant it, but shit,  
my nighttime medicine’s done fucked me up.  
Last night my nighttime medicine fucked me  
up too, & the day before that I took pills that made  
me feel like summer. Today I breathe sleep.  
All of my poems start underwater, except this one.  
Except the next one after this one, too.  
That one starts with a boy forgetting he’s a boy,  
thinking he’s a penguin, thinking he’s an otter,  
thinking  
he’s a horned owl. Is there such things as horned  
owls?  
I nod toothpaste. I pretend to know how long this air lasts.  
Don’t worry, the poem after this one & the next one:  
that shit be twenty feet deep.  
Does a wetsuit get sad if it never gets wet?  
After ghost towns, everyone looks past the coast.  
The movies say aliens. The movies say treasure  
chests, the movies say Johnny Depp’s agent  
making a treasure chest. The movies say Johnny Depp’s  
treasure chest fills its own treasure chest. Holy fuck,  
sometimes the ocean goes six miles deep.  
I don’t know how to think that long.  
Clay says we should run through a forest & impregnate  
our girlfriends. _Our girlfriends just don’t know  
they’re our girlfriends yet_. I nod while wondering  
if an octopus can nod. My first kiss tasted like pizza  
because I had just eaten pizza. I am sick of existing  
casually. I am moving to the west coast to sell  
sunlight.  
I am making my kissing always be in the present  
perfect tense.  
My first kiss was at church. How holy I have been  
given to be gotten.
