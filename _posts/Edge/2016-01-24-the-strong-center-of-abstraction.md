In states of semantic overdrive, visages of abstracted freedom cross  
in the night, heretically. At the summit of neo-aesthetics and visual fields,  
hopeful mind-states ascend according to debunked laws of physics and  
alpha-ruminations. At this time, life ceases to seem linear or any other way,  
and new clichés of Nirvana appear, where and whereby whales exude requiems for  
echoes of anything and everything righteous. Verb tense change. For the promises  
made and kept, silently across bodies of space, strength manifested  
in versions of cliché bravery and kindness, so as to outlast all sinister schemes  
made by the power-mongers. As an inverted pattern of reverse migration, home was  
never a point of departure or a place to return to in time. It was just the strong  
center of all abstraction, where and whereby the falconers haunted the going forth  
to new rituals of orange. The beauty of all before us had never been in doubt, or  
in the past tense. It had only been frustrated and made tired by clichés and by all the  
lonely strangers, longing for (it). While time made an ass of us all, we continued to  
strive, masquerading as diviners of anything that resembled sanity. And so it is  
that we came to know everything about nothing, and nothing about…and so on.
