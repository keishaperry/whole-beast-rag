Yes I love Jesus you stupid cunt  
if I say words like stupid cunt  
cuz he said, “go forth to the Haight  
and hand out needles to  
drugaddictshippieswhoreswhoever.”  
Hospice heliotropes with purple heads bobbing.  
I love Jesus, and I love Osama Bin Laden  
cuz Jesus tells me to,  
but hate the loser’s  
Murder of the innocent  
makinglovemakingartmakingcoffee.  
We killed one in front of his son.  
Wish he could have lived with his sin  
like Charles Manson, another murderous fuck  
that Jesus tells me to love.  
But I gotta love them  
Lord, I gottalottalove  
them  
not judge them  
them  
others Lord—  
them bones.
