I birth alcohol.  
I birth birth & try to give it back.  
I birth stillborns, don’t even ask why.  
I birth Prozac so you can be just sad enough to  
keep going.  
You’re welcome.

I birth Hell & turn the heater all the way up.  
I birth the viciousness in her ex-boyfriends.  
I birth their hands around her neck, their fisted  
welts.  
I birth her always swallowing.  
I birth welted fists fused to lumberjacks.  
I birth concealer.  
I birth a second Hell in case the first one fills up.  
I birth sweaty hands, bad cell phone reception,  
Detroit.  
I birth anger management classes with no sign-in sheet.  
I birth a cloud that will never look like anything else.  
It won’t even really know how to look like a cloud.
