Just pluck the feathers from my shoulder blades.  
Lightness. Noise chopped into moans.  
There are ghosts everywhere & if you catch  
them in the right light, they will become genies.  
_Three wishes_ they say. _Nothing more._  
Even when I am standing next to a wishing well,  
I am wishing I were standing next to a bigger  
wishing well. I wish for longer pillow talk.  
I wish for softer pillows. I wish that one twice.  
In the beginning there was so much caffeine  
everything ran backwards. It was like a movie,  
Adam growing younger, Eve less pregnant  
until she’s no longer bleeding every month.  
Intimacy was never supposed to feel this way,  
attached to an oven timer. There wasn’t an oven yet.  
God was confused. The devil was confused.  
Gabriel said _How will I use this sword now?_  
The world ended & then it started over again.  
In the beginning it was the sequel.  
The sequel always sucks. Imagine how good  
the first one could have been.  
Still, she can put her feet behind her ears  
& that’s a miracle. _Fuck that wine shit_  
I tell Him. _You really outdid yourself here_.  
But still, these sequel days, these bipolar  
heartbeats. I know I am living incorrectly  
when it’s easier breathing through text messages.  
Sometimes rain is hotter than pavement  
but sometimes rain piles on top of pavement.  
I ask God _Are floods man-made_? God is always  
a busy signal. I never have questions  
about angels, not even angles or anglers.  
Instead of thinking, I always leave her  
on my fingers.
