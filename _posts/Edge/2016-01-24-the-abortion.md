my vaginal walls are non-  
stick  
heavily rubbed with butter  
the bladder a silver blade  
gyrates my baby in the bread machine  
her legs whip against my wall  
her eyes sunny side yolks fold into her dough  
yellow blood lights the green button  
my womb flops opens you pull baby out  
you lick baby a glossy, lumpy ball of skin  
slapped & dripping  
back & forth before two palms the manufacturer  
warns: never add wet ingredients  
coconut oil enters the amniotic sac the umbilical  
cord glows at 350 degrees  
Her skull grows yeast  
Takes shape of a baguette’s heel  
my womb beeps it’s time  
baby cools for 25 minutes on a rack
