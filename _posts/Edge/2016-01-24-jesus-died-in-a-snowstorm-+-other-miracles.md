Jesus died in a snowstorm. It was exactly like that one movie  
with the snowstorm where people died blanketed in clean cold.  
Jesus died while downloading the Spotify app for His iPhone.  
He was driving & downloading & that’s dumb & probably illegal  
in like twelve states. It’s possible I’m terribly wrong, I apologize:  
Jesus died halfway through the fifth season of _The X-Files_.  
Dana Scully stayed paused while Jesus pretended to sleep  
behind a boulder for three days. I never believed origami  
could save us, so it was always raining by mid-afternoon.  
Mornings, we could paint them every night.  
It’s easy to forget a good fuck but hard to remember how  
to forget a bad one. Jesus died outside of a strip mall.  
Imagine sipping coffee & watching people.  
These people, they all walk on their feet—  
they hold hands & sometimes their hands are sweaty  
& sometimes their hands are peeled onions.  
Jesus lost sixty pounds on the Subway diet.  
Jesus smelled like a magazine cover.  
I was like _Fuck, man, You’re doing it all wrong_.  
_You have to peel off the edge of the ad, rub it on Your neck_.  
After Jesus died a second time, the earth birthed cracked sidewalks,  
hospital waiting rooms, awkward fire escapes.  
After Jesus died a second time, boredom birthed oral sex,  
the Internet, Ralph Nader’s fear of automobiles.  
There is no reason to keep childhood photos  
forever.  
If so, we’d always stay childhood.  
& before most of it, Jesus said _I can never find the ground  
no matter how hard I look._  
& before most of it but after he said that, I told Him  
_You’re two feet above it, with half a tree of oak behind you._
