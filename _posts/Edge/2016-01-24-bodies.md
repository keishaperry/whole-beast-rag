The body is dangerous.  
The body falls on  
women and children  
like bombs.  
The body infects.  
The body talks  
with thin lips  
on the benefit  
of its fertilizers,  
of its construction materials.  
The body is the champion  
of skin deep religions.  
The body lies  
through its teeth.  
The body says it  
is the true martyr,  
not God.  
The body films  
its acts,  
spools them for  
the backroom boys.  
The body has a head for figures  
but not the heart to match.  

The body is a traitor,  
a dark thunderstorm,  
spokesman for the void,  
a cannibal for the blood,  
gets its kicks out of  
the cruelest count-downs.  
The body is there  
at your bedside,  
proclaiming its innocence  
right to the end.  
The body is  
the last voice  
you hear  
right before  
the room explodes.
