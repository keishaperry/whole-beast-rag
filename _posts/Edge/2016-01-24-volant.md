Alive in the ghost  
Park, I am this  
Darkness. The horizon  
Is a boil of halved  
Strawberries shining  
& illness stitches me  
To the glittery  
Dirt. My hands are  
Broken. They are  
Electric with the raw  
& bleeding organs  
Of beloved pets.  
This world is cruel  
To all things but its  
Grace is unimaginable.  
The unraveling light  
Writes messages as  
Shadows stretch  
From sugar shack  
To whisper-winded  
Playground. Are you  
Almost finished licking  
My wounds clean?  
In the empty  
Swimming pool,  
One flip-flop,  
A disposable  
Razor. A rider-less  
Skateboard hums  
Back & forth. Spider-  
Cracked concrete.  
Spider-cracked skin.  
Last night, I could  
Have sworn  
That cherry-red  
Coronas bloomed  
In the sky. I ate  
Without knowing  
What crunched, what  
Metallic sweetness  
Burst & filled  
My mouth. This  
Morning when  
I opened my lips  
To murmur I love  
You to the yolky  
Daylight, horse  
Flies buzzed out  
Of my throat.  
Marrowsong,  
Dreamwonder—  
Tell me, trumpet  
It through the city’s  
Steel & cinderblock  
Valleys, please,  
Let me feel it—  
What broken  
Animals, what  
Beasts make it  
To the other side?
