It is the summer of Gore’s film.  
This heat was brought to you by greed.  
In a Sargasso Sea between errands,  
you confront the superior might  
of shadeless urban planning.  
Soon water will be rationed, and you’ll stink,  
or left up to the market, and you’ll die.  
You’re taking a chance with that title.  
And with the second person  
if it turns out only to mean you.  
New lawn-trimmer, kittylitter.  
Don’t neglect the connotations.  
Pick up Zinfandel.  
You alone are responsible  
to maintain a class analysis,  
to detect the boast in each complaint.  
You alone are responsible  
for your work. Who else is interested  
in the gelid flux of self,  
or wants to read a phrase like that?  
Escaping either into flux or crystal.  
By the drugstore, a sensible car  
idles, its driver talking:  
you need no longer say,  
on a cellphone. Girls from Our Lady of Victory  
pass in their plaid skirts, shrieking. The psychos  
at the LaRouche table  
have landed a live one. The lid  
of the trashbin floats,  
as always, over Slurpees. But to see  
History plain means no longer to humanize; focus  
on objects, the unscooped poop, the beep  
of the tanker backing into Exxon. The human  
has insufficient breath for the word  
it needs to mutter: History  
is part of nature, will be reabsorbed.  
And so you came into the world.
