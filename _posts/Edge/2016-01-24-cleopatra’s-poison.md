_The stroke of death is as a lover’s pinch, which hurts, and is desired._ —Cleopatra

As much as it is her desire  
it is mine  
To taste the acridness  
of death  
I’d be the asp  
nursed  
at her breast  
milking my way  
toward darkness  
I’d bite down  
pinch  
the nipple  
with my teeth  
roll  
its tender edges  
around my tongue  
You may well feel  
beauty smells  
like grape leaves  
mixed  
with warm blood  
as heart dies  
in ecstasy
