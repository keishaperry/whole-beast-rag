The mass of love density is a cut star / fleeing / heart condition / heat stroke / missing things for all time of this / personal exchange over / the mass of love density is a cut star / don’t free me / (don’t free me) / astral projection in the hands of a saint / solar giants manipulating the body / from a great remove / moving arms legs head / clumsy like clay breaking / being gently rolled / between enormous fingertips
