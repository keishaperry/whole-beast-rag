**1**  
I don’t immediately notice: they’re  
not playing their, so to speak, music.  
I’ve been thinking a long time  
(“staring into space,” they call it),  
am bored with what I’m thinking,  
and normally would blame the music, but  
there isn’t any! And I’m glad,  
retroactively, for unobstructed  
thought, however aimless  
and gloomy. It should be valued, there should  
be silence. This silence  
was like returning to health  
after illness, nationhood after Communism,  
life after death: old habits reappear  
as if you’d never been away.

Somehow you become aware  
that the person over there  
(wherever you are) is an anhedonic.  
There are signs: absences.  
“Sucks all the air out of a room.”  
No; there’s air,  
and air-conditioning or warmth  
as needed, and whoever it is  
is appropriately dressed and doesn’t smell;  
but should you say these things to yourself  
you’ll sense that language doesn’t care.—  
Signs: the dispensable and undispensed  
smile. The unappreciated meal.  
The cellphone closed with a flat goodbye  
and a noticeable click.  
At a gathering, the dull but strange remark.  
And you feel blank rage,  
because by being detached  
from our default position  
of happiness, that person detaches you.  
And probably you react  
by being rude, drinking, leaving;  
otherwise you might see the secret wiring.

A wandering bleb appears in psych-space.  
Inside, one confesses.  
Bartenders become cued  
to phone the cops when, say, a serial killer  
talks; and the police are glad  
to reduce their unsolved backlog. If, that is,  
the phenomenon persists  
and the perpetrator is still sitting there,  
and the bartender himself  
has not forestalled him with his own confession.  
There’s no sense of priority  
or scale, and little pathos:  
no praying, sobbing etc. A surprising number  
of people have no moral sense;  
they make excuses. Others merely obsess.  
Like this guy, who, despite big watch,  
hair, general butch affect,  
reveals he is a weekend transvestite.  
You’d think that, having brought it out,  
he’d seem relieved, defensive…  
A girl has entered.  
In her yellow summer frock she seems  
less a gift from outside  
than a member of a lighter, happier species.  
“Don’t you ever wonder,” he murmurs,  
“what it feels like? The dress  
is a column. Heat rises from pavement,  
unimpeded, past her panties, and  
the sun pours over cleavage; as  
she moves, the fabric moves  
away from, then clings to her smooth belly.”  
“For me the romance,” I say,  
“lies in not knowing—  
watching that alien life a membrane away.”  
“Fearing that, if you crossed it,” he suggests,  
“you’d only find familiar death-bound worry.”  
“In any case, desire,” I say,  
“—if it is desire we’re talking about,  
not fear—mutates  
with age. I’d like to rip her dress off,  
but only in a formal sort of way.  
Instead I could hear her confession  
in this force-field of confessions,  
and comfort, flatter, divert, inspire, bore  
charmingly—extracting, penetrating  
as much as one can  
without physical contact  
beyond a last paternal pat.  
For years I have been satisfied with that—  
sparklers beneath the broad sky of regret—  
and then going home to my wife,  
about whom, also, ordinarily  
I never speak  
because happiness is the true dangerous secret.”  
The zone dissolves; censoriousness returns.  
The girl, having revealed  
nothing, meets someone plausible and leaves.  
My acquaintance also leaves  
for the realms of the unreal  
and doubtless cuts a striking figure there.  
I too should leave, but sit a while nowhere.

When the generals came to Rumsfeld,  
leaving aside the whys and wherefores  
of the war, they said they needed  
at least a third of a million troops  
to win. And he said That’s ridiculous;  
they were not taking seriously  
his stated demand  
for _transformation_ at every level of thinking—  
they could do the job with 150,000.  
Dick backed him. Alone in his office  
at various times Rumsfeld thought  
of the silliness of their objections;  
of the obstructionism of Powell  
and others, who had to be handed  
their heads; of a lean mean  
reliable versatile  
force; of the view towards seagrass  
and Bay beyond the lawn  
at “Mount Misery,” and Dick’s new “Ballintober”  
a mile up the coast;  
of how a simple phone call,  
a partial chuckled word can place  
someone where his talents are needed,  
and how it is reciprocated.  
Eventually dark limos bear  
boxes full of nitpicking and error  
into the vaults and footnotes, but friendship is timeless.

There was a street in Burbank  
between the freeway and a fading mall.  
No trees; signs and storefronts  
the only colors besides beige.  
Two things happened.  
I was at Fuddruckers, the burger place.  
Across the street a crowd had gathered,  
after work or between jobs, at a gym,  
but the doors of the gym wouldn’t open.  
It was a scam.  
It had taken their money, declared bankruptcy  
or simply closed, reopening elsewhere (Nevada).  
Someone was in there, a sweeper.  
In their white and blue and fuchsia  
trunks and scripted T-shirts, shoulders  
already tensed to exercise or pose,  
unused to fruitless time and each protesting  
the inconvenience he or she was suffering,  
they pounded the plate glass and railed at him.  
That street (whose name I forget,  
my memories as partial  
as if they were one-story flat-roofed buildings  
stretched on the rack of a horizon)  
held for a season several used bookstores—  
a density uncommon in LA.  
One was military;  
big flags, the sad silhouetted MIA.  
Two were graveyards:  
dingy romances stacked on their sides. And one  
I discovered the day, or perhaps the week, it was closing:  
not much left, only a few people pawing.  
No overhead, even at its best;  
bare planks, fluorescents dark above.  
Removed, the owner sat by the door;  
incredibly (or so I thought then) old,  
and thin and frail but alert,  
she looked up, not very often,  
from the book she was reading …  
it was Kerouac’s _On the Road._  
Better late than never, I thought.  
Nostalgia? Or had she waited  
once in a coldwater flat  
for somebody’s crumbs of love?  
Her son stood watching,  
arms crossed, with the air of a man refusing  
failure. Was he looking out for himself?  
For her, I felt.  
Perhaps he would see, before she did,  
Sal Paradise and Dean Moriarty  
on a motorbike or in the cab  
of an ancient truck, coming at last  
to find her, meanwhile gathering, redeeming  
the cities: weeping Fresno, mad  
Bakersfield, indispensable dreaming Burbank.
