Out amongst the ptarmigan, we debunk our attention from everything  
else that crosses in the night. Suddenly, the mind goes blurry, and with  
shifting abstraction the pixels shift to the Hyacinth Macaw, then back and  
forth, dizzying the mental storm, allowing for moments of Albatross to  
enter the visual field too. In our sublime encounters with field-guide  
aesthetics, we carry the spirit forth.
