Wheat cow tomato pig, Italian cows in anchovy gardens.  
“If the anomalous is neither an individual nor a species, then what is it?”  
Becoming-wolf, becoming-rabbit, becoming-pizza.  
Alexander was a man who never existed, at least not qua man:  
The pizza Jesus of Orange Avenue,  
An invention of language.  
His avatars were many, though––  
Horizontal outlaws.  
Rapists (statutory and otherwise); blonde bearded managers  
Turned hairless murderers, requiring spectacles;  
Ukrainian teenagers, equally high on domestic violence and America;  
Younger sisters, their beautiful friends;  
An ecstasy addict in an Indian headdress.  
Surfers, surfers, surfers, drunk, drunk, drunk.  
Becoming-pizza: New York. Unbecoming pizza: Chicago, New Jersey,  
Minneapolis, Great Britain, Saint Louis, grade school cafeterias, Tijuana  
Pizza Hut, Japan (so they say), Antarctica (no ovens),  
Outer space (their mushrooms are malevolent).  
Fabio, Fabio: where to begin?  
Becoming-pizza Becoming-marijuana.  
Brazilian, not Italian; heavy metal reggae, Mustang convertible.  
Afternoon ride-along, joint sparked, ticket reads “Naval housing.”  
Becoming-pizza Becoming-marijuana Becoming-fucking-terrified.  
Patriotic golem answers door all suspicious-like.  
Medium pie, clay soldier tips fifteen-percent, exatamente.  
“_Deus quer; o Homem sonha; a obra nasce_,” Fabio spits,  
Marlboro-to-mobile.  
Becoming-tobacco, becoming-handheld-electronic-communications.  
Being versus Becoming.  
Being-pizza: The Noid, also a becoming-rabbit.  
Being-pizza: Chuck E. Cheese, also a becoming-mouse.  
Being-pizza: Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo, Raphael (becoming-turtle).  
Being-pizza: Herman Cain (becoming-Republican, becoming-elephant).  
Anthropomorphic zoomorphs: where have all the pizza boys gone?  
Who will bake the Great American Pizza?  
Who will write the Great American Pizza Novel?  
Who will direct the _Citizen Kane_ of the _cinéma-pizza_?  
There once was a man who ordered a party-size pizza for himself  
And couldn’t fit it through the door of his apartment building.  
So he ate it alone on the front porch.  
That man was I.  
_Was_.
