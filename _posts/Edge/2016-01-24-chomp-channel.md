Am I too perhaps recipient of some chomp channel  
when I close my eyes, roll back, let the dreams  
roll in. Splayed or flayed. Choose your words  
wisely. Elect not to chew/choose your words.  
I too see THE WORDS IN THE AIR. I too need  
a designed distinction. A place in the desert where  
a culture of one. I wake five times the night over,  
transmitting the chomp channel through my wholly  
permeable and permeated skin/limbs/face.  
The chomp channel is all over the cone of my throat.  
The four cone/fired cone of my throat  
makes me go to bed to dream IN ALL CAPS.  
My mother, my godmother. Another night  
singing salt songs, frothing at the pillow.  
Am I too passive a recipient? Dialogue  
download. Shut time. Shut down. Where  
the feeling starts: brain stem. The  
physical sensation of the emotion. Breathe  
into. One time. Center of the throat.  
Wild eye. IN ALL VOICES. I am a  
permeable voice. I am lying still against my  
brain stem. The taste of the desert gathered in my  
line of teeth. My culture of one.  
My line to fall down in. Birth to ditch. A long  
walk. A slow mine. A coal fire. Terra-  
cotta. The warm wet ditch of the earthenware.  
Clay under my fingernails, my red palm.  
The ditch of the basement. The warm rot of  
the empty house. Smells like garbage in here/in  
me. Smells like waste. A long sigh. The slow rot.  
the PERMEABLE HOUSE speaks to me in  
many voices. An aesthetic ring of nails.  
A soft rind of rust. My skin welcomes  
what the walls exhale. The wet rot. Into me.  
Into hair and froth and piss. Ellipsis. The house is  
pulled apart by her seams to let the rot back  
IN/OUT. The rot is welcomed into my lungs.  
The house is rot for my lungs and teeth. For  
a long while now. A break in the swollen carpet.  
A hole in the kitchen wall. For I lay me down to  
steep and rot. The long line, the slow bone.
