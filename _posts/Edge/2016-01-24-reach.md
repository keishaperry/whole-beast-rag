The night terrors are bulls running beneath a sagging balcony  
held together by paint chips and dead termites.  
I huddle, balled up against the chipping brick, squealing  
with the strained hinges at the throttle of hooves. But then you,  
delicious as summer raspberries, indolent as a sun drunk tiger,  
lean against the crumbling railing, all your bones  
adjusting effortlessly to the sway like a fox trot. Deadly nimble, you smoke cigarettes  
with strange and stale grandfather names like Winston, Chesterfield,  
and the confidence of a film star before cancer came along.  
Through the slats, cattle run in a braided rope of bodies,  
a tight and desperate line of muscle and sweat, hooves compacting the sand,  
grinding scattered syringes and bloodied cotton balls into shards  
and a frothy tan soup of scat. Iâ€™m too scared to grab onto your  
calm extended hand or your belief that my bulls are imaginary  
as candy petaled roses, and nothing I can say  
will draw you away from that edge, toward safety. So we stand  
unmoving, trapped frozen in the glass bubble of a protracted minute  
despite stampeding time. We share  
a cooperative paralysis, each wishing we could hold the other  
down, to protect them from their vaporous and dangerous delusions  
as concrete and preposterous as imaginary bulls.
