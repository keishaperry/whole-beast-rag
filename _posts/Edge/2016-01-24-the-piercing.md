There’s a place  
For the numb  
Who flock  
Like lusty mosquitoes  
To flickering neon signs  
And grimy store windows.

It’s a dingy fortress  
Of peeling paint  
And dusty shadows,  
A haven  
At the fringes  
Of society’s  
Demure skirt.

There’s a man  
Behind these walls.  
He’s decorated  
With inky scars  
And torn skin  
Embedded with silver  
Like shining shrapnel  
Meticulously placed in  
Ecstatic self-mutilation.

It’s said this man,  
This witch doctor,  
Back-alley surgeon  
Can find your pain.  
He can mark you,  
Transform you,  
Undo you,  
All at your request.  
Cash only.

This threshold  
I’ve crossed alone,  
My resolve  
Not attenuated  
Despite the sweaty bills  
In my pocket  
Enclosed in  
Trembling fingers.  
He knows already  
What I need  
Before my voice  
Has time to languish,  
Waver, or dissolve  
Into the hum  
Of fluorescent light  
That depicts me as wan  
In the warped mirrors  
Decorating the room.

He guides me  
Into the back,  
A private chamber  
Alive with graffiti  
Crawling on the walls.  
I convince myself  
I’m not frightened  
Anymore.  
I want this,  
I always wanted this.  
Besides, I paid up front.  
I won’t turn back.

There’s nobody to see us,  
To stop us,  
Interrupt us,  
To save me in case  
He hurts me,  
Goes too far,  
In case it gets  
Out of hand.  
Or to rescue me from myself.  
But I’ve been  
Insensate for so long,  
As if doused  
In Novocain,  
And I don’t care any longer.

I know what’s to come,  
The tool he will use.  
He takes it out,  
Shows me,  
Assures me it’s clean,  
Asks me if  
I’m nervous.  
I’m not.  
Truly not.  
Just do it.

He touches the spot.  
_Here_? He says.  
_Yes_.  
_Ready_? He says.  
_I guess._  
_Ok, take a deep breath._  
I oblige.  
He looks into my eyes  
Then grabs me, the spot  
In a firm grip  
And pushes,  
Penetrates, thrusts,  
So slow, tantalizing.  
I feel it, all of it,  
Every inch.

The sweet sensation  
He awakens in  
My nerves  
Standing on end  
Through every  
Erect hair  
On my body  
Is exquisite, real.  
There’s a puncture,  
Almost a pop,  
A drip of blood.

I feel him  
Slide it in.  
Hollow shaft,  
Surgical steel,  
Needle through my skin.  
He pulls it through  
The other side.  
I feel it glide  
Through my flesh.  
The hurt,  
So damn good  
To feel at all.

With another jab,  
A ring goes in.  
My metal scar,  
My shrapnel jewel.  
I wince, I cringe.  
My body  
Throbs around it  
Like a little heartbeat  
Born in my wound.  
Already I want more.  
A yank, a twist,  
The ring is closed.  
I’m done.  
No regrets.  
I tip big.  
Until next time,  
I want more.
