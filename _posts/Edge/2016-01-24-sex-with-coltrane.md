Are the children opening mouths like hungry saxophones  
Clamoring for bread from my bread music?  
This exhale of ours bellows in and out  
And does not look like a wind instrument  
Must be a fool’s hat collecting coins  
Never earned by my frail mouth, not like Coltrane  
We never slept in the same bed  
Coltrane and I: in the same bed I’d fumble.  
Yet you wind inside of me and I become your  
instrument  
Now the breasts on my lips  
Soft like the rolls I’d bake  
When I finally clamored myself to you  
Earning that key no door will unlock  
I wake to find you seamed against me, Coltrane.
