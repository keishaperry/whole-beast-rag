What had happened? One moment  
the upper-under and lower-working  
classes, vast, tattooed,  
eyes averted,  
randomly pugnacious,  
or both, were roaming  
that restroom of a lobby,  
popcorn underfoot, their children  
crowding the grimy arcade before  
the shows. On offer: vampire blacks,  
idiot race-car drivers,  
supernatural thugs, and suddenly this darkness.  
My reaction was awe: Al Qaeda  
was choosing smaller targets.  
I could see the logic. (Though some of the  
fragments  
around me would say, no doubt,  
it was the Mossad…) With the need  
to chatter one feels at such times, I found  
a paleoconservative to talk to. (I knew him  
by his prissy vest and his unblinking stare.)  
“You know, we probably regard  
these people with the same complacent  
despair—except you think they’re free  
and want them to be obedient  
and I the reverse. Though I wonder,  
why were you standing in line  
to drop ten IQ points?” He  
lay silent, disdainful of me and the rising  
flames. More good-naturedly:  
“It’s strange how an old socialist  
and an old reactionary  
find themselves in a similar impasse.”
