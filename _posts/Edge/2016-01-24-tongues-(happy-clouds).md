When this poem makes me famous & richer than poet  
rich, I will buy a bigger cock. I will buy a bigger  
frame  
for my bigger cock. I will love my bigger framed cock.  
On comment cards at resorts I’ll write _Six hundred  
& fifty-nine dollars a night & we only used the floor_.  
I will have bled both of us dry by this point, fed  
our hearts to bigger hearts, wrote _You are so blamed  
in your buttoned dress_ on the inside of your spine.  
On TV Joel Osteen wants us to be richer, bleach the fuck  
out of our teeth, pray for everyone with wives who think.  
God bless an empty eternity, the foreshadowing of senility.  
I have never titled a poem “Things God Told Me”  
because I’ve never seen a bush burn but not burn down.  
I haven’t seen _Amistad_ but I hear it’s sad.  
I’ve seen _Schinlder’s List_ but that’s more olive.  
I am only moderately attractive while drying my hands  
with a dirty dishtowel. Being in Heaven is robbing  
a pharmacy every Monday morning & never getting caught.  
& on the fourteenth day God made girls smell even  
better  
when they’re naked. He taught me how to turn them on.  
It was the repeating effect that stuck.  
Outside always felt like happy clouds, iced coffee  
in a glass that never knew how to sweat.  
Always, I keep her so blamed in her buttoned dress.  
& God said miles were good. He was losing Himself.  
This is somewhere in Exodus, the third chapter,  
right after He goes _Small pox, I’m glad you cleared that up_,  
but before He says _That night you’re thinking about,  
you’re welcome_. Never try to cut a baby in half.  
Seriously, Solomon was just fucking around.  
& gay people, they’re pretty much okay.  
Somewhere in Proverbs: _Running water doesn’t care  
about sodomy_. Somewhere in love, a boy penguin  
flippers another boy penguin.  
Leviticus is all just _begat begat begat begat begat begat  
begat_ with a bunch of names impossible to pronounce  
shoved in between. Just skip that one, okay?  
There are four books in the Bible where the same shit  
happens. Just skip those too, okay?
