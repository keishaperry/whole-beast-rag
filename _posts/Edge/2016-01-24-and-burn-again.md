When shaking begins  
the last gasp resides  
in bone marrow  
Embrace the burn  
as it explodes a vessel  
of blood thought  
into silicone slivers  
into little purple flames  
that turn  
crisp as black  
as they reveal  
a clinging  
blaze that opens  
when the eyes pop  
and wilt into  
unknown
