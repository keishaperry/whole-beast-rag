I am a ball of quivers  
crashing through my mother’s gore  
and slathered in footsteps.  
I am a bag of earthquakes  
screaming inside of cells  
built out of wrinkles.  
my wallpapering  
is painted with needles  
and speckled with nausea,  
peeling at the eyes  
where the war is in flames. spoken in flames.  
the Everything Void  
swirls before me.  
I can’t breathe when I’m swallowed forever  
by its unending gullet.  
I am floating,  
osmosis ringing in my ears;  
the stars seep into my bloodstream  
and I can taste the distilled liquid of unused  
molecules  
(it is chilly, barely elegant, and fills me with  
explosions).  
my circuits sputter,  
and the night is coated in acorns  
as I dance and stumble  
into chains.  
sometimes  
I want to kiss the blue pavement.  
and once  
I was born out of focus
