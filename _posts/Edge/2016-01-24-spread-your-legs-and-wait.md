(Finally. So many years gone and flushed down the toilet—between the both of us millions of miles traveled and oh so many hours spent re-tracing the steps moving away and coming back and other lovers. Oh yes, there were others…our genitals ain’t innocent. And our spirits are battered. But here she is…belly still flat, her face not as fleshy and teeth stained over just a hair though that same desperate adolescent melancholy, that same tongue-twisted doe-eyed exhilaration is still flickering…and I can’t get it up. I have to stall this shit, but I’m not a witty-type. “A witty saying proves nothing” I read—that’s by Voltaire—read it on the back of a tea-bag dip-grip thingy. An insightful quote while you meditate through that broth of leaves and steam. Yeah, many years ago we came close to it, but I was bound by another. And one night she was bent over, gray panties in my face, lounging, yeah, listening to Leonard Cohen—horniness in the air—I wanted in—she wanted to break something.

But in those days I was hunched over a bong most of the time…and she bent over in my face like it was an accident. I knew it wasn’t. She knew it wasn’t. It was a potential turning point, the opportunity, an offering. But see, back then, with her, it wouldn’t have taken much effort. But ah, those panties hiked up, all the flaps hangin’ over. And harkening back, I’m thinking of pollination now. Please accept that I’m not really the type who objectifies; but that’s not the point. Also, FYI: the world has never been my oyster—I don’t even know what that means. I mean I know what it means but I’ve never and will never experience that saying. It just isn’t in the cards. I live a block away from a Jehovah Church; the bells ring every hour on the hour and it startles me every time. That’s not a good sign.)

Ever been ripped on coke before? Well, that’s when things started to go bad with her, back then. I’m a dirt-bag: was, is, whatever. But that’s not the point either. I never flew that way really. The coke per se didn’t actually contribute to her reasons for leaving. She did it, too. I was just a dabbler = spitting pseudo art ponderings, words spewed over half crushed cans of beer strewn about on the porch at 3 a.m. Meanwhile she went out and became more than I. She went out and did something. These days, she still performs, and one day she’ll probably be famous. And I hold this against her. As for myself, I treat people like animals, pet them. That’s as affectionate as I get with my daughter. Sometimes we’d lie on the couch and I would stroke her forehead, and she in turn would blink her eyes slowly, drowsily. This was love. With a cat or dog there’s literally nothing. I only look at animals. She kind of knows that I have a child but I don’t feel that it’s in my best interests to elaborate on that tidbit. Or maybe it is. In any case, she’ll go on to do wonderful things. I won’t.

I had a dream. We were in Italy sitting outside a rustic coffee shop on a sidewalk patio. There were low-hanging ferns and the color of molded cement in the background. I was wearing combat boots. We were drinking espresso and discussing things like how artistic people discuss things and feeling on top of the world. I was smoking a beautiful, yellow papered cigarette. It burned very slowly. The dream was tranquil, refined. Nothing came of it; a banal discussion, bloated by our own success. We were observing young women passing by, laughing quietly. My legs were crossed and I was sipping the espresso, the combat boots shining in the dull light. In this dream I was a success. That’s probably why it lingers.

In a different dream, she and I were being interviewed for a job. We were sitting in a large, rustic- luxurious boardroom on the ground floor of whatever building we were in. It felt like we were in a huge, log-cabin-like complex. We were interviewed by a group of perhaps six people, but I can’t recall every face. We were seated at the end of a long boardroom table. We were nervous but not entirely uncomfortable; we just wanted to ace the interview. Sitting between us was a woman with long, curly-black hair. She was Psychic and was to determine if we were truthfully answering whatever query was posed. The main character interviewing us was male, well dressed, crew cut gray hair, sixty years-old. Despite his somewhat refined mannerisms I had the feeling that he was a Bad Boy. He liked naughty things. Maybe he was a swinger or something, but what I’m sure of is this: he was, in some way, a closeted non-conformist. Also present was a man wearing a long fur coat, very tan and muscular, with a prince valiant haircut and finger nails like Mickey Rourke. He said nothing, but looked at me with a bemused smile. I think he liked me. Also, there was a woman who resembled my mother, but am certain wasn’t. Had an icy reserve. She looked at us both with bored dead eyes.

_Questions posed by the Bad Boy:_

Him: So. How’s your marriage? We like certain types of couples…strong bonds…but, eh, we’re lookin’ for… something…

Me: Well, yeah, even though we have a kid, and are…somewhat unconventional, we have varied interests. Personally, I’d describe us as being an eclectic couple.

(I felt this was a good response; they seemed satisfied.)

Him: And have you ever committed an infidelity?

The Bad Boy looked directly at me. He stared at me. Then, she, her, the one laying on my fucking bed right now, with her legs spread—responded before me: No.

Me: No.

The Bad Boy continued to stare at me. I stared back.

Him: Ha! He didn’t break his focus (gesturing to the other board members)—I don’t know what to make of it!

This is the first time he looked to the Psychic, wordlessly prompting her. She in turn glanced at both of us with a very soft concentration then looked back toward the Bad Boy.

Psychic: She…is telling the truth. He—(long pause)—I think…is as well.

At this point I must’ve sighed or have cultivated an air of annoyance because the Bad Boy said:  
It looks like you have something to say.

I spoke. I can recall only fragments. I was perturbed and touching my face, to which the Psychic replied that this was a common mannerism of a liar. But I didn’t lie, didn’t feel guilt. I was guilty of nothing. I had never cheated on her. Whatever I said, it was the truth. But the Psychic’s attitude annoyed me. And the Psychic was annoyed that I was annoyed. When I finished my tirade the interview ended, abruptly. The Board thanked us. The woman with icy reserve had a few short words with the Bad Boy and left the room immediately thereafter. Then she and I looked at each other. I realized that we failed the interview. We were not going to get whatever it was we wanted. And it was my fault.

Now I’m here in this instant. We reconnected via web 2.0, and met at a club. I honestly never expected to see her again, but thought about her at least once a day. “Poncho and Lefty” was playing off the juke in the background. She’d had a couple PBRs and was horny, I could tell—had that same look from way back. We were talking about Steve Reeves and how his movies were fucking garbage, but had somehow paved the way for Stallone and Schwarzenegger. She was intrigued, somewhat. When we broke it off 10 years ago I weighed 180\. I now weigh 245\. I wear it well but with my clothes off you can tell how fat I am. She basically looks the same as she did then.

As mentioned, there were others—for me, two different Hilary’s, a K.C., a Betty, a Megan. I don’t know how many she’s been with. We go back to the place, to get pretty and fuck—her idea. We get ready together in my bathroom, since it’s so big. It’s a long, drawn-out drama or scenario or performance. To watch her file her nails and brush her teeth and shave it for some reason…sitting on the toilet extending her abdomen, trying to keep her pubis flat and tight. Then it all starts in the bathtub: I shave her legs and do what I can with her pubic hair then she bathes and finishes the shaving. I’m scared of nicking it. She gets out, dries off; tangled wet hair, water dripping down her back. We neck, I bite her lower lip. Yeah, her mouth is hot and wet…kiss her deeply; our faces glaze over, lost in a flower maze.

She gulps at my tongue. The taste of her mouth, her pale thighs. I kiss her nose. We’re drinking a little red wine, not much, but I can taste the ingredients in her mouth, the smoky residue left behind. My genitals ache and know what’s coming, what’s maybe just 20 minutes away. I bathe and shave  
and trim the hair of my nuts. Clip my nails. Add moisturizer. Little dabs of cologne on my dick, under my balls. Slick the hair back. Brush the teeth. But things just can’t stay under the surface for long, our bodies are impatient, and now that we’re bathed we can’t keep it together and stick to the game plan so I just lunge at her, pick her up and cup her ass, slide a few fingers into her and spread it, and sit her up on the sink stall, I’m not even thinking of it, it just happens: My cock just goes right in and it’s predictably hot and tight and wet and she grabs my ass, and throws her head back, mouth open, and pulls me in as far as it’ll go. I carry her to the bed, connected, my fingers wet, our eyes closed.

She and I are fucking with no sounds: dry squirming over each other on our own flesh with no vocalization—just deadpan, rhythmic undulations. This sex is the meaning of something I’ll never understand. She’s with me, engaged in the process I suppose, but I am ultimately no more than a task. At least that’s my impression. Nonetheless, we come together the first time, hard. The second time I finger it at length and she sucks me off, her breasts brushing warmly against my inner thighs. Come eventually dribbles onto my flabby stomach and she tongues at it; noticing this mild expression of perversity I choke up with spasms of absolute joy and gratitude. Memories and recognition of what we were, something that was almost long gone, pass before and between us as we meet each other’s gaze for perhaps three seconds. I don’t know if she recognizes me anymore. Now there’s no connection. Afterward we lay and stare at each other, completely disgusted.

Slow motion POV montage:

—Wide shot of her, naked except for red panties, standing in front of a dresser, playing with a 12 gauge shotgun. She points it at the camera, laughs.

—Medium shot of him on the bed sitting up, hair slicked back into a ponytail, a pair of Lennon’s on, pointing a flashlight, a spotlight, onto his cock, which he flexes back and forth. His head is tilted back, and he’s saying something, but there’s no audible dialogue.

—Fade Out.

We’re lying in bed and lapses of time fold over us, and I remember the memory of childhood—the way I used to think, the way the air used to smell; everything. Then she embraces me for no good reason. Her kindness with the open light behind her startles me and I want to hold her too, but I don’t. She pulls away. She will never be the same girl who affected me in those expressions of grace and morale; more than all the indentured apparitions and innocent bedroom groans that gave my life purpose; I think back to my head lying on my mother’s chest, knowing that one day her heart would stop and I was frightened that it would stop right then and I would cringe and try to move my ears away from her. At age five, I truly believed that I would be dead before I was 17\. And at 17 I kept telling myself that there’s no way I’d make it to 22 and so on. Homemade crucifix on the wall, staring down at us; I whisper to her three times, but there’s nothing decent or clever left to say.

I talk at the ceiling:

“You know what you are? You’re an inhibited, middle-class dipshit. With middle-class values and middle-class ambitions. You were raised to be that way. You have always been that way. You will always be that way. You believe in paying your dues—college, the job, the eco-friendly cars, the dinner parties, exercise. You think you’re a part of something? You think other people notice this?  
How can they? They’re too busy living the same ritual, drilled into their heads, hung-up in their pathetic little pursuits—”

“Stop trying to fucking figure me out. It’s tedious.”

“And you think I have no talent. I know it. You’ve never told me that, but I know it. We used to compete, intellectually, artistically, but every comment I made got nothing but rolling eyes from your admittedly tight ass…and now you think you’ve won. See, for me, it’s all or nothing. I had a  
dream about us last night, just listen—”

“Then you’re nothing. And I’m not going to have relationships where I don’t gain anything. I seek intentional relationships. Like, for instance, co-workers and general friendly acquaintances such as  
yourself be damned—pretending to appreciate them, to understand them, courtesy laughs, all that. Save your thoughts for the lucky few, the ones you’re committed to. That’s my take on it. And you’re just…not one of those people. As far as my ‘success’ is concerned, not everyone pays their dues, and not everyone is rewarded for their loyalty. I wanted it— you, or it, or this, or whatever. And now that I’ve had it…well, for me, there’s no vigor after get ing what you want. Right?”

“You’re so ambitious. And now the joker, the one who dispenses the jokes, has finally stared both of us down. He’s staring me down at least.”

She’s asleep or pretending to be. I turn to look at her and for an instant want to do something to her for not being awake, for me. I can’t reach out to her. How can I? She sleeps like a child—cup her belly, her soft spot, we spoon. I’d give her the Sun in a box if I could. She’d pasteurize her breast milk into cheese if I asked nice enough. Dull and frozen: ¾ of my brain is rigid, petrified by a lack of self-confidence, but the core of it, a jazz drummer. Yeah, one dead dream after another; fatigued and constipated in the early morn’, bored throughout the afternoon, and drunk into the night. A disciple of my own memory day after day after day after day. Nothing more than a decayed brainless relic who even in his heyday was useless. Yes, we’re through. Finally.
