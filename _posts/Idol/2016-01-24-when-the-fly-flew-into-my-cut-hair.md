When the fly flew into my cut hair I greeted it  
And when I saw my cut hair on the floor I greeted it  
And when I saw your face begging for rectification I greeted it  
Rectify I mean your sorry-saying  
Pointless perhaps but you say it anyway  
When the Dutch held Rembrandt on high I greeted him  
And when Rembrandt was in my bedroom I greeted him  
When he touched his nose to my laminated Iggy Pop poster  
The poster melted on my green wall and the light from  
My lamp made out of silver chains echoed like the bottom  
Of a waterfall  
The very bottom  
Where no one dreams of going  
Maybe the Dutch dream of it when they eat bread  
(My friend eats challah and I’m jealous  
I greet him with a photo of my shoulder  
And I say that I am jealous of his bread  
And he misinterprets this I think as unprecedented fondness  
I send him down the waterfall I’ll follow eventually)  
I asked him: Rembrandt your paintings are so dark and dimly lit  
They make me feel vampiric and velvet-covered  
Did you mean to do that  
And the way you painted Jesus did that come from a vision  
Or personal experience  
And when my heart was so big it could contain the Middle East I greeted it  
And when my hair was drenched in apple cider I wrung it out into a basin  
And poured the liquid into Rembrandt’s mouth  
Wide and open
