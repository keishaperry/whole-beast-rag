A body falls out from the sky  
its arms are boneless, squiggling  
its eyes are snow globes  
itâ€™s wearing a tie and is foaming at the mouth  
it bounces on the ground a few times  
and then a hole opens up below it and it falls in  
and the hole closes  
/  
A knot of snakes floats across the sky  
slowly and in one direction  
perpendicular with the horizon  
\  
A jack-in the box slinks inside a ravine  
back and forth, trying to get out  
it is covered in flies and bees  
surrounding the ravine are thorn bushes  
decorated with bells the shape of baby faces  
that clang in the occasional breeze  
/  
A chainsaw with eagle wings  
flies directly into  
a white bust falling out from the sky  
the raining marble cubes  
land perfectly in the mouth  
of a sleeping kelly ripa  
\  
A giant knotted ball of neckties  
and the neon sign next to it:  
BEST TIME TO BE ALIVE
