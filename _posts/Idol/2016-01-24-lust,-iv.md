_after Aubrey Graham_  

Dust off the champagne  
and dress the rappers up like  
lion tamers: we’ve got to all-  
star weekend the women  
that are waking up  
to our falsettos on their  
phones. Homies are  
So Far Gone  
off the lights in these  
three different  
cities which are  
forever converging into  
this seismic excess,  
an ambient landscape  
manifested in all the raining  
dollar bills and jewelry  
that none of us can afford—  
this is everything we’re  
going to have to work for.  
This is the poem for every  
unlocked door in America.  
This is the cigarette burn  
in a rented Rolls Royce  
that we’ll never  
be able to explain  
to our mother. This is  
The Calm, so rise  
up from your wheelchair,  
young money—rise up from  
that wheelchair and  
let’s headbutt some  
basketball players.
