let these words  
be a battering ram  
through the stargate  
into a new field of vision  
to flummox the energy  
field deception wave,  
a new death projection  
betwixt the circulation beam––  
amplified sound  
just circulating  
the celestial light of molten auras  
I have held flames in my mind  
greenish blue  
siphoning air  
from dimensions of darkness  
because I am a moon lord––  
diseased with penetrating dreams  
of altered realities  
really, the very focal point  
of our energetic awareness  
broken out of the hell-forged chains  
of my wretched birth  
from the far flung  
galaxies of the elder star gods  
the antediluvian archons  
fading  
in and out  
of this reality  
and into the next one, where form becomes formless  
the fabled gods and legendary beings––  
owls act as cosmic intermediaries  
and this is when the advanced spellcraft took hold  
via subtle energetic vibrations  
I am inventing psychic landscapes through volume  
I am speaking of suns beyond sonority  
of varicose moons and sanguine fish  
of colored spheres drifting through the vast planetary theater  
of pentagonal ratios, of palingenesis  
this world’s the curse we live with  
the myth of mold and honeysuckle  
cycles of the golden ghost  
through advanced carbon weaponry––  
through the chalice of dismissal  
the fruits of my discontent shall sculpt the air  
in chiseled layers of atavistic artifice  
brandishing a psychic mess of arteries  
the oracular owls shall guide me––
