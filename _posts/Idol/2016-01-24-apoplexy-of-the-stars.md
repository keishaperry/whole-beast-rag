yes in this  
black dimension I radiate  
DNA in the silver way  
a matrix of sword  
and sound dissolved in decay  
in the underworld the lion-headed man  
stalked me, magnetized to my fear  
siphoning the dream-stream into darker dimensions  
yet Bhairava has set a flame in my heart  
magnetized to the density of decay––  
hybrid stars of alien salt and ether  
blackening the cloud  
to communicate  
an echo  
planetary essence  
swords fell into the density  
of elemental spheres  
telluric acid in the vile sky  
hardened air sculpted  
into images  
spirit wave annihilate  
the ulterior intelligence––  
lord of the seven spheres  
I enhance that oracle zone  
into the night zone  
spirit eclipse  
sigil to the stars––the black dimensions  
I call home  
no source of space  
clouds that violate salt embers vibrating  
brandishing the echo  
of a dream  
the circulatory matrix  
being a digital fabrication  
nerve net apostle  
from where the shadowy night gods  
transmit spooky wave tones  
dimensions of silt, sand and rain stone  
the sleep of Chaldea shall rain  
like the ritual dream spheres of nuclear geometry  
relegating the shapes of sound  
apparitions of liquid light  
voided dimensions bloom in angry sand  
thrust into the black wind of death’s feeble dream  
mind of the boundless spheres  
death dreams of shapes  
of sound  
of apparitions  
of liquid light  
blooming into death’s ultimate vortices––  
the sleep of Chaldea shall rain no more
