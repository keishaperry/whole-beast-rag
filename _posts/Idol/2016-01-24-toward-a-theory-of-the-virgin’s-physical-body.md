in thinking  
about snakes  
I see her  
legs glazed  
in sweat & the beige  
of taut rubber bands  
she curves  
in two directions  
each foot pointed  
intricately north  
& southwest  
sprawled flat  
& shaped like seaglass  
her bones conspire  
until only shorelines  
veer left  
(she has sand  
for kneecaps)
