I sit on the edge of the bed. Stare at the dresser. There is something over there that I want.  
I get up. Walk there. Open a drawer. Reach inside. Grab a pair of black socks. I look down at my  
feet. I am wearing black socks.  
I walk back to the bed. Sit down. Pick up my phone. Focus my eyes. Thursday, 7:26 AM. Put the  
phone down. Stare at the dresser. There is something over there that I want.  
I get up. Walk to the dresser. Grab hairbrush. Focus eyes into the mirror. My hair has already been  
brushed.  
I go back to the bed. Sit down. Pick up the phone. Thursday, 7:28 AM. Put the phone in pants pocket. Stare at dresser. There is something over there that I want.  
I get up. Walk to the dresser. Grab a razor. Smooth the skin flat with fingers. The stubble is missing.  
My face is already shaved.  
I walk back to the bed. Sit down. Stare at the dresser. There is something on it that I want.  
I narrow my vision. Verbalize: nunchucks, Glock 19, straight razor, sleeping cat, hair brush, Lilac  
Vegetal, Old Spice deodorant, mirror, Tanach, steaming mug  
of coffee.
