Stay awake, listen carefully boy,  
this is important.  
The day is for sleeping,  
but before the sun goes down  
make sure you’ve gathered enough wood.  
Look. Look over that way.  
That’s east. If you’re ignorant  
of other facts, your job is just keeping  
track of that, just that one  
direction. Hold it in your blood.  
No, remember, one day  
(You’re right, one night. Don’t be impertinent)  
a bright flame will be leaping  
on that hill—that one, across the sound.  
That night is the whole use of your manhood.  
Our fire will glow. It means that they  
have broken the walls of puissant  
Troy—yes, Troy. Trojan women weeping.  
Children cast in wells to drown.  
There will be no city where the holy city stood.  
Now listen, I’ll die soon. No boy,  
don’t cry. Here’s flint and steel. You can’t  
forget our mission. We send news sweeping  
to Greece (really to that round  
hill over there). It’s our joy, our duty, our good.
