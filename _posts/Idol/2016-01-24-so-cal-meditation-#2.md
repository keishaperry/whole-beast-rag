Set loose in a carbon rich environment. It seemed we were free. Except for impromptu odes to the emperor. Porcelain statuettes of oligarchs unpacked from the transient’s van hung with rectangular price tags. Black market: stand out in the sun. By the apothecary and bahn mi shop under new management. The vow of the people is heard against their intentions. Mars in retrograde. The decorative glass of wine raised to the unmothered streets. Of corn syrup sweets. Unset bone rendering the body’s frame askew. It’s frustrating in every way. The love she had for flowers. Deep dark purple flowers. That took the shape of fire in the non-existent spring.
