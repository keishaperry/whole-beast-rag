to the luck of any god  
dressed in nothing but the sheet  
you have slept your entire life  
then go down as no good  
into the pit of yourself  
stripped of all wonder  
I read where the skull of Vitalis  
patron saint of genital disease  
will be selling at auction today  
weâ€™ll stick a red tab  
where the flower had been  
cut for your induction  
a dozen or so doves  
let back into the sky  
versed in little but light
