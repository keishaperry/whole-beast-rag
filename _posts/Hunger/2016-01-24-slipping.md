A fact of summer:  
it slips into autumn, sags a bit.  
This was the hottest July  
on record, a good excuse  
to sit indoors, read books,  
contemplate a shifting metabolism.  
When the temperatures lift,  
we move into the garden.  
Of course there is wreckage.  
The storms were violent this year.  
The winds flattened trees,  
left ostrich ferns broken.  
The birdhouse in the river birch  
survived, but there’s no sign  
of the inhabitants.  
Autumn is all about cutting back.  
Eating less. Growing hard and thin.  
Me with my pruning shears,  
a growing pile of spent flowers  
and wrong branches,  
a trunk full of brush for  
the city compost site.  
The beauty there is what  
we’ll find next spring:  
rich black soil where  
all we left was waste.
