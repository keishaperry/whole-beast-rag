Once the ship had been crushed by ice,  
they knew they would die. Each night,  
as they tried to sleep inside tents fashioned  
out of tattered sails, they heard the wooden  
vessel cry. High pitched, sometimes;  
sometimes, low and rumbling.  
That which was never intended to snap  
did just that, planks three feet thick  
breaking easy in the ice’s grip, like  
kindling for a fire they would never build.  
It kept them from sleep, the unflagging cold,  
the deadly bite of winter’s teeth.  
The ship’s scientist had brought along  
a camera. A week after they’d eaten  
the last of the dogs, he pulled out his cases  
of useless instruments and started to record.  
No one needed to know the temperature.  
No one needed to know the wind’s speed.  
It blew through everything—canvas, wood,  
walls of ice—it penetrated the skin  
like merciless needles, sutured the eyes  
shut with tears. With matted hair  
and chaffed faces, frost-blackened noses,  
they posed. The scientist labeled each negative  
with his subjects’ names, then packed  
the plates in sturdy wooden frames,  
placed them in a hut made from the last of the ship.  
Some men posed singly, as if sitting for a portrait.  
Some in groups, the ship’s crushed hull  
their stark backdrop. They were already ghosts.
