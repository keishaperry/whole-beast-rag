Summer is cold spread thin, stretched taut  
over land and water, unbreakable. She says,

it is cold that goes into heat, always.  
Hard ice melts into your drink, and the cold

penetrates; take a sip. Heat, she says  
succumbs to a drop in temperature, he is

the weaker of the binaries. They stand by the fire,  
wood smoking at their backs and eyes electric

keeping them warm. It is the chill leaving as they draw  
stupidly close, arms fastening around waist and neck.

Heat pulls bodies together, the need for lack  
for the diffusion of cold, for a new-old kind of loss

and its arrows. The mirror of dew, the saint  
of wet grass and dirty knees, the ground beckons,

and her answers are silent, as though she knows

his warmth will regulate, as though his breath  
can make her breathe calm. But they are choir magnets,

mouths hot, open, kissing like they just now  
remember how to. The cold an afterthought, nearly

extinguished; the fire lilting, shifting, and then left behind.  
They trace patterns in the mud to the woods,

nothing cold about love made new.  
The distant laws of chemistry class, forgotten:

the impossible way that heat does not  
transpose, that you never get warmer,

only less cold, a lesson that loses itself in arms  
as temperature transfers through now nude bodies

lit by dim, distant lamps. Insects mourn in hush  
on the brink of morning, the crisp hint of blueâ€“

edges that cannot be located. No map will  
find two wrapped as one, a solid temperature

shared and therefore not a concern. She says,  
that summer is winter spread out, face down,

waiting; the something right about something  
chillingly wrong, something destined to repeat

like the rising and setting of the cursed, orange  
Pennsylvania sun.
