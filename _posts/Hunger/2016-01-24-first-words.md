When my body came out of my mother,  
she pushed; I pushed; flesh tore.  
It was no neat cut—tissue tangled purple  
and later, even stitches would not hold—  
swollen scar uncoiling, a silver nitrate snake  
between her legs.

And yet my father’s version omits all blood  
and begins instead with a dream

he dreamed  
when I was still  
inside my mother that he  
was in the middle of a vast, green field,  
on his hands and knees, searching  
for a four-leaf clover  
so I could be born.

He searched for hours  
before he found one. Then he woke up,  
and I was still inside my mother.

He spent the whole next day searching  
on his hands and knees, and right before it got dark—  
right at dusk when it’s hardest to see—he finally found one,  
and that night I was born.

Fable birthed from the gap between these two when their bodies were as close  
as two bodies can be,

that rupture was mine—_why did you steal it from me?_
