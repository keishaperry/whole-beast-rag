A resolute man, in his hunger for wonder,  
goes searching for the next best thing.  
The first Seven Wonders are inconsolable.  
Their time is done.  
Each starts to take itself apart, brick  
by brick by log by stone. Each leaves enough  
so that the man might be punished  
when he sees what’s become of them.  
He travels for years and thinks he finds  
new wonders. His suitcase expands  
and contracts as he adds, then subtracts  
those things he thought were rarities.  
Time passes and winds blow  
and finally, everything left is buried  
in sand, except for the artifacts  
housed in museums. But even these  
don’t thrive. Roman marble faces  
on proper British walls grow sad  
and sag until they’re expressionless.  
No one remembers what the great Sphinx  
said and the Hanging Gardens are gone,  
like the Colossus of Rhodes;  
mere ghosts in their own lands.  
The resolute man never comes home.  
Hunger knows no boundaries  
and what might have been  
his garden paradise is now a desert.  
Who would recognize him?  
His name fades from history  
and his portrait, made when  
he was young, resembles no one,  
or anyone; pale green eyes,  
short brown hair,  
a smile shy, but beguiling.
