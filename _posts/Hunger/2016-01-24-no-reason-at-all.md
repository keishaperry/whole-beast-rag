Out amidst the orchard of choice, we dabble in requiems and font  
styles. We concentrate our thoughts until they become  
aluminum charms in semantic worlds, word-worlds  
away. We point to repetition as a charismatic  
device and alouette to the Mid-West for no  
reason at all. The grammarian sticklers  
peruse the catalogue of noise for new  
rituals of austere Julep and make is  
possible for agrammarian humanimals  
to rise up in ironic rapture.
