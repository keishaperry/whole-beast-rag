i celebrate my successes with pancake breakfast.  
and i light off fireworks in my driveway; in my kitchen; in my car; beside the river;  
in my living room :::grandma hopping from her seat with a jiggly-dance of surprise.  
wisps of smoke linger in the air.

// party stanza //

outside i’m bad boy.  
inside i’m sweetheart.  
all the girls close enough know this.  
they do with it what they will.

i slurp a slurpable at the frostee-glo  
watching girls shift about  
in their weekend electric.  
i see everything play out before it even happens.  
i have that gift; or curse;  
because it sucks my life of all the risk.  
and without risk we wither,  
and we bleed out from the brains:::  
right there, in front of everybody; my brain;  
oozing and mixing with chili-cheese fries.

girl::  
she puts herself to myself,  
and our selves become more than they ever were;  
more than they’ll ever think to be,  
more than they’ll ever hold to the darkness alone.

her body; my body; our  
smattering of colors.  
i flip her onto her back :::dance fibers:::  
so this; so me; pressing my hard into her soft:::  
bearing down into her glossy:::  
she laughs and weeps; like boom; then whispers in my ear.  
culminato lingering;  
she trembles in that long-end-tremble //pancake breakfast//

life foreseen:::  
pay the rent:::  
buy an eighth:::

meander half-stoned, half-asleep, wholly horny through the aisles of WinCo, staring at a soccer-mom’s yoga-pants’d-ass; so well contained; so much like canteloupe  
telepathically bound to my chub.
