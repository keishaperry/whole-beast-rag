A Parkour court in Leicester  
will reduce antisocial behavior  
among young men.  
The flabby third acts of American lives,  
a cotillion of bloat, poor motility,  
the easy. “A bore is starred,”  
the Village Voice wrote of Streisand’s  
remake that I watch on the plane,  
her four-octave range squandered.  
With the collapse of Goldtrail Holidays,  
the CAA wonders how to bring  
stranded holidaymakers home.  
Bjork bails out Iceland  
whose bust wiped out Nottingham.  
Not all chronology is decadence and science.  
“Load every rift’ . . . with ore,” Keats told Shelley.  
Yarn becomes a bow in a flash of hands,  
butterfly bushes grow wild along the tube,  
and swallows spiral and bank like hive mind.  
No other physical challenge is as difficult  
as holding a life in my ears.  
A BBC Three program tells us that chronology  
is more than the immaculate degeneration of our cells.  
Depth of field is a corridor of stars,  
and Clouds of Magellan shimmer  
like Dame Edna’s rhinestones, a basket  
of Easter grass, excelsior, a cabinet of Swarovski  
crystals at Harrods, the surfeit of light that absorbs us  
as we walk across the ocean floor  
from the island to the mainland at low tide.
