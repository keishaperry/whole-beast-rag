Right here between four walls window brown tree, no sympathy. Unremitting thirst. Think. Do go through step, bread milk gas car party child, real gold is. Listen. Baby intact. Steep price paid each intention/invention, gold from big brain, no one else. Dig. Slippery slop. Truth hidden behind noisy train comin. Listen especially hard if fat lady isnâ€™t through but near. Singin. Train comin. No horn. Either. Not polite like ocean not the same, gold; hysterical, her scream start singin, he said, choose one, listen. It/her say need. What. Keep on singin that scream. Alone on that empty ocean. Polite. There. It is. Chopin.
