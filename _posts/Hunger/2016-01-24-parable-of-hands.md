Where his fingers grasped mine,  
where his wrist curled sideways,

I came alive.

An expanse of paper gleamed  
Like desert flattened sandâ€”

letters bloomed thick lobes  
surviving in spite of  
(because of) the glare

the way tiny cactuses come  
to their growing forms.

I drank water  
and I memorized words  
and I practiced all the turns

he desired my young limbs to learn.

I walked the desert with one shoe on

and one foot stayed soft  
and one foot burned.
