I don’t care about the metrics, the iambus  
and the rhymes—I have read the classics and then  
I’ve put them back on their dusty shelves:  
we write about something that comes from the guts  
and the nails as the flowers outside  
explode…  
The poetry, can I say that I don’t care?  
I prefer to drink alone in this room in front of  
one candle  
as the shadows in the corners sits and show us  
their ugly faces;  
ah, I know that the words are greater than we thought  
and we will fall in their holes,  
we will spill ourselves like ink upon the Chaucer’s paper:  
let me be myself while I read the classics,  
let me be afraid in airplanes,  
let me be bored in churches,  
let me be silent before the tigers in my blood:  
these words are too tuff for us to misspend them  
just like the big boys during their time.  
The rivers are flowing through me  
and I burn like matchstick lighted by the words  
of all Shakespeares…  
And today I am closer to insanity,  
I am watching the black birds on the wires,  
waiting for our degradation,  
for our small defeat while we walk upon the land of  
Dylan and Frost, especially on the thin ice  
of Frost…  
…find me one small torch,  
not too big, just big enough to set this night on fire  
and I can hear outside the young girls laugh,  
never heard about the hunger of Villon or the madness of Pound,  
please feed me so well and I’ll never again use their words,  
let me find a little warmth,  
allow me to find my sunflowers  
shaking in the wind  
and under the sun  
and the God of the Word not Death.
