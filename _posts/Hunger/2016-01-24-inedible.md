A harvest of words  
has brought us here.  
Over-ripe,  
their skins fizzing with scabs  
that ooze,  
the words swamp the air around us.  
Our scythes, perched like birds  
on our shoulders  
tremble at the task ahead,  
at the slaughter.  
With a last look back  
at our moments of tilling,  
we trench in,  
pulling our memories behind us,  
our words,  
our festering fruits,  
before us.
