ask the porous, perforated skin  
of a fig tree:  
what dance?  
we swim in contested waters  
a musky border lake  
where the eggs we carry  
crack open  
spill golden blood on the  
lolling water’s tongue  
whale watchers sing  
“our inheritance is dead and dry!”  
a closed harbor  
man-made, holding hands  
at the backroom deal  
beware of the lurking Mafia,  
heartbreak and oil-slick  
these toxic messengers  
broadcast over the white-noise highways  
that stretch out  
cover more of the air with their  
tyrant groaning  
like Sun Ra, I long for quiet space  
other worlds with different frequencies  
my friends make war drums from  
fallen oak trees and deer hide  
I tinker with the radio  
try to turn it into a spaceship
