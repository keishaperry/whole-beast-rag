The yellow curtain swings with the wind,  
an elongated egg yolk dancing beside me.  
I lay on the couch,  
my ribs sticking out like fork tines  
and my feet cold and wet  
with gardening water.  
The world is flooded  
and I am spread on it like a broken door,  
floating bones for wood,  
a sail made of skin.  
I wind myself up  
as the day comes to a close  
like a nerve ending pinched flat.  
I bury my head in the musk of the pillow  
and dream of a supermarket on  
Saturday mornings,  
a hunger like a boiling pot at my center,  
urging me on.
