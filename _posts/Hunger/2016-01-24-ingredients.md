REMIXED DAILY, COMPOSITION SUBJECT TO OBJECTIVE INFLUENCE:  
MIGHT BE THE CHEMICALS, MIGHT BE THE STARS. PROBABLY THE UPBRING.  
AT LEAST NOT JUST IN MIND, MY MIND.  
MADE UP MAKE-SHIFT RATIO FOR SAKE OF STUDY. DIET OBSERVED DAILY.  
RITUALS RE-EXAMINED.  
EVIDENCE: INCONCLUSIVE, ONGOING.  
TO EXPLAIN THE TWILIGHT IN MY EYES,  
I LACQUERED THE CATARACT OVERHEAD, BEGIN PURGING UPON THE PAGEâ€”  
TO BALANCE OUT THE INTAKE.  
YOU SEE, I SAW ANGELS FED EXQUISITE SLOP FROM HEIRLOOM TROUGHS.

DESPERATE & SLOSHED WITH COAGUALNT, THEY BECAME THE BEST PRETENDERS,

TIPPED THEIR TIANIUM DIOXIDE HALOS AT AMIABLE ENTITIES ACROSS FORMICA ISLANDS. BUT BEHAVED DIFFERENTLY IN THE DINING ROOM.

VERY LITTLE TO SAY TO EACH OTHER.  
AFTER GRACE I WATCHED THEM WOLF DOWN THEIR RIBOFLAVIN FEELINGS.  
MIND-READERS DIGESTING FERROUS SULFATE WITH WEAK STOMACHS.  
AT SOME POINT, I MUST HAVE DEVELOPED THE DISORDER TO DEAL.  
PROGNOSIS: PROACTIVE IMAGINATION. SIDE EFFECTS: HYPERAWARENESS  
UPON RE-ENTRY INTO PRESENCE OF OTHERS. COULD NOT LOOK AWAY  
FROM WHAT THEY WERE: MORE THAN WHAT THEY ATE.  
SO BEAUTIFUL DESPITE INDOCTRINATION.  
HYALOPTEROUS AFLUTTER UNABLE TO ELEVATE HOST BODY BAGS OF BONES  
ABOVE THE FACTICITIES OF THEIR MORTAL MAKE-UPS.  
KIND, FUN-LOVING CREATURES REALLY  
EVEN WITH THIAMINE NITRATE IN THEIR FLUSHED CHEEKS,  
NIACINAMIDE WITHIN THEIR NAPES, PHENYLALANINE BEHIND THEIR SMILING EYES.  
NONE TO BLAME.

I WAS MADE TO LOVE  
THE PECTIN IN EVERY VERMICULATE WINDROW ON THEIR FINGER TIPS.  
TO SEE THE UNEXPLORED RIDGELINES IN THEIR DEXTROSE JOWLS.  
THE HINTS OF CARRAGEENAN IN THEIR LIPS BESPOKE SUNSET  
TO MY ARTIFICIALLY ENHANCED NATURALISM,  
I TOO  
FOUND PYRIDOXINE HYDROCHLORIDE IN MY PROPYLENE GLYCOL AORTA, CARBOXYMETHYLCELLULOSE IN MY CALLUSES.  
OUR SORBITAN MONOSTEARATE COMPASSION HELD SHARED ELEMENTS TOGETHER, GROUNDED US  
WHEN METABISULFATE SOLAR PLEXUSES SPOILED.  
THOUGH OVER TIME GLYCEROL ESTER OF ROSIN DECAYED,  
THE REALIZATION OF THOSE BONDS PRESERVED COMFORT.  
WHAT CHOICE DID WE HAVE BUT TO SUBORDINATE OURSELVES TO OUR BELLIES?  
AFTER ALL, WE FALLEN ANGELS WERE ENTRUSTED AN INTANGIBLE INGREDIENT  
WITHOUT WHICH THE RECIPE FOR FORGIVENESS WOULD FAIL TO RISE  
EVEN AT THE MERCY OF CHEMISTRY.
