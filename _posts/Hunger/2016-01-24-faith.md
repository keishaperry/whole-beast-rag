I’ve come to believe there is no god, just a balance  
of sorts: each bad thing weighted against a good.  
In this sense, the ancient Egyptians had it right:  
the god Horace with his scale, each human heart  
weighed against a feather before entry to  
the underworld was granted. I doubt anyone  
could make that journey now. There is no bird  
with feathers heavy enough to match the burden  
of the human heart. It’s in the news everyday:  
a war here, holocaust there, a desert country  
starving while some men own cars worth  
more than the gross economy of a small nation.  
When the rich lose anything, they weep at their  
bitter misfortune. When the poor have nothing,  
they don’t wonder what it means to lose.
