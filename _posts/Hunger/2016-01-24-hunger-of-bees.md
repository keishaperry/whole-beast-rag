A steeple fingers a darkening sky as no thoughts of  
Jesus hover halfway between a mourning dove calling  
in soft tones from the power line and a boy and girl  
deep in the oleander. And as their anxious mothers  
call for the children to come home and eat, the  
children learn of the hunger of bees. And the steeple  
casts no shadow, and the dove can’t feel the current,  
but perches, making small, cool sounds unanswered  
across dusk’s animate air.
