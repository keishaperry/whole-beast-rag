Noon has fallen into recline  
Like a lazy metropolis  
Upon boughs and crumbling moss-coated roofs.  
Its yawn simmers in your chest.  
Oh how will you cook that eggplant parmesan  
When you are moss-coated  
And leaning like a slanted roof?  
When your irises have grayed out like skies?  
You won’t be able to see the redness  
In the tomatoes of the vegetable aisle  
Or the bright blue of your debit card  
Its dull guillotine sheen  
Your neck over the register.  
The bus’s head beams cut through your fog  
Like a lighthouse on a fluorescent shore.  
You will yawn and spin the wheel seaward,  
A slow gradient into night.
