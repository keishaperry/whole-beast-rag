I.  
In the unexpected heat of a late autumn day,  
speak aloud all of those things you don’t want.  
Call them out by their names. They can’t hide  
in the sharp October light. They can’t be buried  
under brittle brown leaves. Say their names  
and they’ll appear, one by one. They’ll look  
at you. And then, they’ll disappear.

II.  
Everything smells so ripe and done.  
Dry leaves skitter along the street.  
Listless bees move from flower to flower  
but nothing’s left to eat.  
My body wants to pull itself apart,  
my limbs want to scatter themselves  
among the weeds and wild asters.  
Twenty years ago I didn’t know  
what a wild aster was, or why autumn  
always brought me to my knees  
in breathless fear and prayer.  
Now I know why these thing occur,  
and I say, everything that has the will  
to bloom is a flower.

III.  
Wrens at the feeder in early November.  
A single white cosmos blooms atop  
a spindly stem. Blood red lilies’ stalks  
are dry and brown, their leaves resemble  
long blades. Some boys are going  
door to door, offering to rake or  
bag leaves for cash. Everywhere,  
houses in foreclosure. The inhabitants  
abandon their lives. The neighborhood  
fills with strays. A black cat approaches,  
sweet and small. I give him some food  
and water, and he quietly moves on.
