the sliced half-lemon in hand  
kitchen greetings  
happy birthday Solomon  
sea breeze in nostrils  
fresh rinds spruce up the trash  
smell of city streets  
scraggle of cats stuck  
in the apartment windows

wander the alleys  
modern Bauhaus buildings  
old mosques down the way  
millennial dust stuck  
in the nerves  
cause slight glitches in the traffic and  
oily coffee

wake up from afternoon siesta  
feel a light rush in my belly  
like a citrus tree in bloom  
take a walk down to the beach where I  
sit on the rocks and wait  
for the Jaffa orange sun to touch the horizon,  
also maybe a vision  
a cool hand on my shoulder  
or more wispy strands of  
magnetic lichen  
growing, dying  
inside and around  
my ache of lank limbs, laughs and sighs

the surf growls hums and will  
never quiet  
content for now that I can sit here with  
nowhere else to be  
no name for the land to call me  
but a new-old  
olive idea  
let the wind and airplanes sign here:
