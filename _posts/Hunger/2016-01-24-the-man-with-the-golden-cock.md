travel  
make love  
work  
the way the lamp-lit-lot glowed on just my car  
her hand against the window  
i made money selling workout equipment: thigh hump gear  
door-to-door,  
my teeth  
drank vodka in the dark of my motel  

like,  
sippy sip, on my juice cup  
yeppy yep, yup yup  
they squirmed on me: those beams of heat  
like diagonal-cut colors  
she laid her body against mine  
throttled at something butterscotch  
used my belt  

i had no idea my cock was so fucking fierce  
so formed to rip her abdomen out like that  
goddamn  
it took all night to clean up her guts  
like yolk  
soaked into the mattress
