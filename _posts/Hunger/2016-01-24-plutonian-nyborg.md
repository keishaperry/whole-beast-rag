rough raggedy punches  
to my smooth somewhat sexy face  
that fucker  
that face fucker

my loverboy sway breaks  
by fire cold motion all at once  
in that;  
that strange messy darkness  
that phantasmagorian light:  
city skymorphic

she was stuck in my mind  
and all i could do was spit teeth

under luminesce  
under bloody clump of bathroom  
i rebirth  
i frost my nostrils with plutonian nyborg  
and dance like nasty  
dance like sasquatchy  
dance along the curb eating tangerine, and yeah  
it might mean nothing  
but i love:  
motherfuckingtangerine

later moments:  
i ease my thoughts along chrometipped strawberries  
girls with rollerkicks  
royale with cheese  
seering its electric to my tongue

the stars rust as my drip drip  
does as he does  
night thick  
beachy wet  
the other she licks at my bloody  
the other she licks at my molten

wastelust, thus i am.  
thus;  
some die in love.
