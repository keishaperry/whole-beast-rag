shiver and buzz  
all about my skin  
hum of the noon hour  
at the falafel shop  
I sit and try to peel my worry  
like the skin of a strange new fruit  
salad sits limp at the side  
with potatoes, potatoes  
and corn  
to eat or to plant deep in thawing ground  
at a loss for land and finance  
the motherland calls  
she sends rare taxidermied birds by air-mail  
they are wrapped in delicate cellophane  
and smell of attics and sandalwood  
it’s all in the juice of our ancestors  
this waiting-room ballet,  
dropped in cans  
handled with slight grimaces  
knowing looks  
chided child  
the radio offers overripe bananas  
my dry hands accept  
these winters are not what they used to be  
though the sun hits the windshields at similar angles,  
the breeze ruffles shaggy hair  
in need of a trim
lackluster lunch,  
still the best meal of the day,  
Mr. O’hara, I concur  
a chance to slip away from the dirty streets  
heavy arms of the cuckoo  
out under the lime green facades  
that gather ice and shout down street performers  
on the street of cheap gyros and haircuts,  
to take a moment  
remember discarded things  
like twine and wooden toy blocks,  
place some fragrant dust  
in my front shirt pocket.  
say a prayer for those pigeons  
antennae all tangled in the glare  
a shame, really
