This way for kings and madness,  
This way growing-cold light  
pointing its sharp finger how it pleases–  
Demanding obedience like a stage.

Humanity scowls, critics ever  
So much room for us to be like  
the trees–  
But our eyes close, nodding toward and backward  
intimately caressing the sweet enraptured light,  
agape in splendor.

Sink into cushioned honey seats  
made from the feathers of angel wings  
dismembered from guilty conscience

Phallic paint-peeling master  
contains its force within, bursting forth  
like some aquatic power from a crack  
in the cement,  
Stands in front of Judge scanning individuals,  
Always criticizing  
forever an opinion  
alone in belief  
wishing for respite  
but everyone feels  
the longing, desire  
of knowing  
the need to fill our chest cavities with something,  
something real, something whole.  
We all suffer.  
The girl in the red dress finally  
wears something we can understand,  
feeling transcends knowing and everything is clear.  
Eyes open and close so gracefully it is as if  
blinking is an art form, trapped in the label  
of reflex.

Beautiful red dress girl becomes my Queen  
because she wants to, because everyone is alone,  
because just in case, because forever isn’t long,  
because love is sitting in front of our gaping eyes,  
because as these sunken pits see flame and char and life  
our mind embraces another kind of truth,  
the truth of apple blossoms in springtime,  
filling the air with nectar and spice,  
reminding the world of its power.

I sit here today obedient in love  
and I know only the heat of red reflections in the mirror  
and I see only the heart pumping thick blood  
and I long for that time of the day where the sun  
falls past my vision and the  
sky is a deep glowing red exit sign  
illuminated once every twenty-four hours.

The red of love becomes cold white of night,  
beats out warm notes brighter  
under starlit sky.
