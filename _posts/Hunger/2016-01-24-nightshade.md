I slip on my silk tunic,  
go out into the yard to gather in  
the evening harvest  
my head is fittingly light  
for this task  
I reach the threshold of the eggplants,  
ponder planting my head  
into the soil beside them  
what purple dreams I would have  
I run my hand through my hair,  
admire the suggestive curls  
of basil leaves  
lean over to pluck up  
a few snap peas  
looks like they will have  
a good crunch  
the last lasers of sunlight  
are bleeding out  
over the city  
I take my snacks  
back into the house and  
place a jazz record  
on the turntable  
languid warmth of summer  
milks my bones  
in the kitchen  
blue flames  
hold the simmer of  
black garlic  
while outside the window  
night birds sing along
