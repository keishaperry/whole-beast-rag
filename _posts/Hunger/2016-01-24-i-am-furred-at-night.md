When my eyes turned black at night  
and my breath ceased to haunt the midnight air  
I knew that my long feet were soon to thump  
the powder underfoot.

Outside, harshness is a way of life.  
Outside, everything is imperfect,  
and absolutes are rare.  
Life is absurd if youâ€™re an animal  
but it is more so as that iterative process  
evolution creates bipedal monstrosities  
too naked and thin to survive  
by surviving  
instead we must live off each other,  
off instead of on, because that would be degrading.

The world takes us in, alone  
and returns us much the same way,  
though are we wiser?  
Should we be afraid of death?  
Does change make us stronger?  
When did comfort finally rear its head  
and make me think it was a good idea  
to wear loose fitting thread-fur and  
talk about existential importance,  
from middle to end.

The loneliness is consuming,  
binding my waking hours in knots,  
I see the black and white shadows  
on packed snow, and I whimper  
hair standing stiff in anticipation of anxiety  
and it comes like always, it wrenches  
my heart through my mind; I cry out  
but the years of fear have done their work;  
my mirror tells me what I have done  
so I return to what is simplest.

To my furred will-to-survive spirit  
I send, now trembling with wariness, a quest  
to unravel the secrets our two-legged brethren  
have chosen to ignore. I pass knowledge from  
one frightened absolute to another, live in a  
place between quiet acceptance and raucous upheaval.

Today, I will wear my soft fur suit,  
listen as trees grow, and embrace  
the fact that each depression nap  
might be one too many. The last.  
The few to store in a cardboard box  
on the top shelf.
