**WINTER**  <br/>

I.  
The hungry moon  
on the drum  
Demons beat and howl  
Songs of old and new  
fancy dancers  
Into the cold night snow falling  
on empty streets  
a wolf pack hunts  
for a surge of energy or rush  
to devour  

II.
Vodka ayahuasca
On my vision quest
I went blind

**SPRING**  

I.  
April ends  
let me get it  
quick!  
the egg is hatching  

II.  
hila  
fountain  
giving life  
</div>

**SUMMER**  

I.  
Passive design off the grid  
Eye want to build underground  
Destroy and take away  
To fill the fleeting beauty  

II.  
Dandelion root tea  
leaf salad  
with garlic mustard  
and flower wine  
</div>

**AUTUMN**  

I.  
Italiano  
SoMafia  
IRA  
Hungry at the Dispenseria  
Thirsty at the Coffeeria  
Family at the Drinkeria  

II.  
Coyote moon  
hungry not full  
dark with starlight  
the Big Dipper thirsts  
Hoo! the owl thrives  
Time for the wolf  
I am so hungry I cannot love,  
only eat, sleep and dream  
of donuts  
and the black hole in the center  
so  
no matter how many I eat  
I still feel empty inside
