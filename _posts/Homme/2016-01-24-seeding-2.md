2.

Ellen’s calf bawls.  
I skim the milk,  
dip my fingers,  
let her rough lick,  
tonguing and suckling. Milk.  

She’ll butt the pail,  
smell the milk,  
I know it:  
She’s a dumb wobbly-thing  
with stupid legs. Milk.  
Mary. Milk.  
Has stupid eyes, too  
that bawl blue  
when no one’s looking. Milk.  

Cheerful cheerful  
by God’s own grace  
to race. To race  
the grave. Milk.
