Ma scraps the boiled orange  
from a shredded carrot to color white butter,  

presses it into pretty  
strawberry leaf molds for Paâ€™s haying supper:  

(blackbirds, blackbirds, baked in a pie  
shot you down from the prairie sky  
blacktears, blacktears, watched you cry  
grinding up the flour for the chicken fry)  

Mary and I eat the shavings,  

roughage for keen eyes on the buffalo wallows,  
sharp enough to see the wolves.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listen to the Indians,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;press a cold tongue  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the ceiling of my mouth  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(lay a hot hand  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to myself  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the piecemeal quilt)
