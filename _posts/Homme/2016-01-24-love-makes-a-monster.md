Be delighted by this blaze.  
While today had a touch  
of yellow gladness, there  
was much shallower gloom.  
Day plucked from night  
breathed all over these  
stuttering seconds, and  
those sparks circled inside  
the skull of an hour’s ring.  
The skins side of a mask  
hid the contents that trickle  
curves of new contracts:  
complex strategies, duties  
that keep our many days  
from caving in. It is never  
enough to take you out to  
big cities, balancing these  
nervous whistles with my  
dry tongue. And I know not  
to mistake your lovely face  
for a resting place that holds  
a man’s desire. At home,  
I collected standing stacks  
of slim handsome books  
and learned to cook for one.  
But love, you must believe  
I never planned this fire.
