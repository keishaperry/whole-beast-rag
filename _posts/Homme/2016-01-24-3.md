&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homoerectus  
pulls bark from an African Plum tree  
to scratch a line into a cavewall.    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exaltation sends him dashing out  
charging toward his tribe in camp  
collecting them to acknowledge the event.    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cave  
four of his kind stand in wonder  
he’s created a recognizable figure. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At sundown  
hunters hide below the Agapanthus  
stalking two antelope.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sketcher grins privately  
as his troupe barbecues their dinner  
he signs the cavewall with animalblood.    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning  
the tribe shares freshly hunted meat  
but he accepts plums from a female’s hand.
