Your feelings lie down on a moth-worn blanket  
like a farm dog.  

The weather gives you  
a sense of purpose and your spleen is the sieve  
that filters out the tar in the world, so you hide  
out in the seascape of your brain: the briny deep  
beneath, the undulating lift of water,  
the soundless pressure;  

the octopus in your heart unfurls a map  
to another ocean, another ocean  
endless, or unending: the swim is tireless,  

your tentacles taut  

when you heap your body  
into the chewed bed  
littered with stale hay, sunshine;  

nothing is racked  
into neat bales.  

It took thirty five years  
to get slick. Or did it?  

Your brain, the sea;  
your nerves, the dust mote.  

Now you taste the salt in everything.  

You could quit.  
You could keep going.
