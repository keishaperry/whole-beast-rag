Nose-prints on pages out,  
pistol smoke admixed  
with bloodied background.  
Evidence of university  
purchases seem discarded  
while asleep. Petrified eyes,  
inside day-sight that cannot  
see. Had such a discord  
poured dark thoughts into  
cracks, until eventually he  
was pushed on an unsteady  
roll without a majority of  
purpose? It seems that his  
mind’s balanced wave had  
gone erratic, as if a forger  
sold a stable life for wild  
satisfaction at any and all  
cost. But blue and red neon  
screams and tattered marks  
did tell: dead stop of a dated  
watch, papers white-lined  
lasers, the major threat to  
tired eyes. For a finale, he lit  
one last fire with loud colors  
before cradling down a dark  
left turn, leaving a fatherless  
daughter of a doctor who  
steered silently into distant  
sparkling directions, never  
speaking a word of his woes.
