_I. ALLEGORY AND SYMBOL_

<div class="col-half">A temporary eclipse. The intentionality of
rhetorical figures. The association of
rhetorical terms with value judgments
that blur distinctions and hide the real
structures. The poetic language of genius.
The subjectivity of experience. A
configuration of entities that designate a
plurality of distinct and isolated
meanings. A configuration of symbols
ultimately leading to a total, single, and
universal meaning. The idea of a
transcendental distance between the
incarnate world of man and the divine
origin of the world. The landscapes and
places that are often described at the
beginning of poems. Their considerable
poetic authority. The fact that they are not
synechdoches designating a totality of
which they are a part, but are themselves
already this totality. The antimony
between allegory and symbol. A special
case of figural language. No disjunction
of the constitutive faculties. The material
substantiality. The spiritualization of the
symbol. The transcendental source, albeit
in an oblique and ambiguous way. The
assumed superiority of the symbol in
terms of organic substantiality. A
description of figural language as
translucence. The very prominent place
</div>

<div class="col-half">given in this criticism to the study of
metaphor and imagery, often considered
as more important than problems of
metrics or thematic considerations.
Synthesis. The tendency shared by all
commentators to define the romantic
image as a relationship between mind
and nature, between subject and object.
The fluent transition in romantic diction. A
closer, more faithful observation of the
outside object. A greater inwardness.
Experiences of memory and of reverie
that stem from deeper regions of
subjectivity. The manifestation, in
language, of a fundamental unity. The
sources of the unifying, “symbolic” power.
The eighteenth-century loco-descriptive
poem. Eighteenth-century theoreticians of
the imagination. _Associative_ analogy.
Working monism. The critical–and even,
at times, the poetic–vocabulary. Words
such as “affinity” or “sympathy.” The
formal problem of congruence between
the two poles. That of the ontological
priority of the one over the other. An
intersubjective, interpersonal relationship.
A relationship of the subject toward itself.

_II. IRONY_

Around the same time that / the theoretical speculations of the early romantics go hand in hand with a theoretical concern for the trope “irony” as such, / the use of irony is conspicuously absent from / the implicit and rather enigmatic link between / the constitutive mode of all literature and / a dialectic of identity and difference. Nevertheless, / the relationship between sign and meaning is discontinuous; / it clearly lacks discriminatory precision / in the form of a common concern of some writers with both modes. / The link is made in many critical texts: structuralist studies / from the very beginning / described irony as capable of coloring an entire discourse / from the localized trope to the extended novel, / although / even the superficial and empirical observation of literary history / bears a by no means obvious relationship to / the advent of a full-fledged ironic consciousness, which / is not necessarily accompanied by a parallel interest in the theory of irony; one has to wait until / they show a prevalent tendency toward aphoristic, rapid, and brief texts, / as if there were something in the nature of irony that / cannot so easily take refuge in the need for a historical de-mystification of the term, as when / the tension between allegory and symbol justified this procedure: the mystification is a fact of history and therefore must be dealt with in a historical manner before / irony becomes increasingly conscious of itself. / We cannot escape, therefore, / a great deal of assistance. / Curiously enough, / freed from the necessity of respecting historical chronology, / the accent falls on the notion of _dédoublement_ as the characteristic that sets apart a reflective activity, such as / the notion of self-duplication or self-multiplication, / the concept for the sake of which / one would indeed speak of difference in terms of the superiority of one subject over another, / when the concept of “superiority” is still being used when the self is engaged in a relationship not to other subjects, but to / a discontinuity and a plurality of levels within a subject that comes to know itself by / the activity of a consciousness by which a man differentiates himself from / the material of the cobbler or wood. / In everyday, common existence, / the reflective disjunction not only occurs _by means of_ language as a privileged category, but it / divides the subject into an empirical self, immersed in the world, and / the moment that the artistic or philosophical, that is, the language-determined, man laughs at himself falling. / As a being that stands upright, / man / is quite powerless to convert even the smallest particle of nature into something human, / a progression of self-knowledge / that the writer or philosopher constitutes by his language / despite the fact that it involves laughter, / the moment the innocence or authenticity of our sense of being in the world is put into question, / and, most clearly of all, / a consciousness of madness, itself the end of all consciousness. / The ironist invents a form of himself that is “mad” but / this might be construed to mean that irony, as / a cure for a self lost in the alienation of its melancholy, / at once arises for the ironic subject to construe its function as one of assistance to the original self and to act as if / it does so precisely by / reasserting the purely fictional nature of its own universe and by carefully maintaining / the bourgeois idyll of the end / that the hero and the heroine, far from having returned to their natural selves, / represent figures from the _commedia dell’arte_ floating against a background that is precisely _not_ the world, adrift in an empty sky.

_III. THE PREFIGURATION OF A FUTURE RECOVERY_

_The isolated, alienated man nostalgically aspires
toward unity and infinity; the world appears to him
as divided and finite. He cannot overcome_

the subjective region of fiction. Every word is right.
Every word is wrong.
The dialectic of self-destruction and self-invention
is freedom, the unwillingness
of the mind to accept any stage in its progression as
definitive. _Infinite agility_. Die Romantische
Poesie, Die. But this same endless process—
the poetic self engaged in its own development—
finally, _the irony of irony_. The temporality
is definitely not organic, no end, no
totality. Only: a past that is pure mystification and a future
that remains harassed forever by a relapse within the inauthentic.

Fiction and reality could coincide: a
leap out of language into faith. Yet could we bypass

the temporality of all language? The definitely non-ironic? The
_pure poetry from which laughter is absent
as from the soul of the Sage?_

The text clearly is not ironic. Either in its tonality or its meaning.

_IV. SLOW, MEDITATIVE MOVEMENTS FULL OF REVERIE, ANTICIPATION, AND RECOLLECTION_

These lines are curiously ambiguous.
The difference has been spread out.
The structure of irony, however,
is the reversed mirror-language of this form. This is the instant

at which the two selves
are simultaneously present, juxtaposed
within the same moment but as two irreconcilable and disjointed
beings. The structure. A synchronic structure. The pattern of factual experience

as a successive mode capable of engendering duration as the illusion of a continuity
that it know to be illusory.

Things get somewhat more complex.

All perceptive critics have noticed the emphasis
on the moment with the resulting discontinuity. These episodes
are allegorical and emblematic, caught

between the truly perverse assignment of using both the narrative duration of the diachronic allegory and the instantaneity of the narrative present. The myth

is that of the unovercomable distance which must always prevail.
