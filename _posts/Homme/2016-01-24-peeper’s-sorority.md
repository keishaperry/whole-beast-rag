The woman’s voice gleams with oddly translated survivor guilt.  
In her arms I’m breath held in.  
I’m many bipolar suckers pulling the trailer park of a lung.  
The rise of the capillary roams fruitfully, but it too must burn.  
This is not what I meant by Martian technology.  
In the woman’s spurn my balls are her stockingless bronze.  
Of the many intelligent dogs she fucks, less than one of them is me.
