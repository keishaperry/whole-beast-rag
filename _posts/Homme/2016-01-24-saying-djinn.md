All my girlfriends have the names of dead children.  
Placentas for eyelashes, tricycles for tits.  
An Evian bottle filled with blood  
Completes our crystal dome of air.  
And as a tribute to my masochism they assassinate a cow.  
Its aromatic funeral milk resuscitates a vast waste of dentures.  
I scam like a newscaster, and cut my smiles from magazines.
