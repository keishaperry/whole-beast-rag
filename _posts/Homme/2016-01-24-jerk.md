being a jerk is what I am best at,  
no lessons needed,  
naturally a son of a bitch.  
now all my toys are broken,  
and all that I loved has gone  
cursing my name.  

maybe now it will start to sink in,  
all those lectures I received  
on my parentsâ€™ knees.  
maybe I will finally learn  
how to be nice and good,  
and treat people like I should.  

maybe that will happen,  
but I doubt it.  
it is easier to stay  
with what you are good at,  
and this nasty mongrel dog  
is too old to learn new tricks.
