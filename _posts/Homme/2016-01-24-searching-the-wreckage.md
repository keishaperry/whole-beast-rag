You chose to be  
what you chose to be,  
and I chose to be  
who I was.  

We may have started  
in a different place,  
but we ended  
in horror and flames.  

I toast the wreck  
that was our lives,  

If you stole  
more pearls of joy than I  
who is to blame?  

My fault was simple.  
I cared too much.  
but it ended all the same.  

In our next life  
if we should join,  
I hope we twist less  
in the wind,  

and quickly sail apart  
before we become  
better at wounding  

than loving.
