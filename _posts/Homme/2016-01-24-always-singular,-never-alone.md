I quit drinking Cristal
Not because it’s prejudiced
But because Jay Z says
It is intolerant.

When the Jigga man says jump
You look down at the earth
And you say ‘all paradises
Are imperfect.’

So I never-never ever-ever gonna be seen sipping on the Crissy again.

Unless it’s free
Or it’s too dark in the club to read the label
Or it’s too dark to read
Or I’m just drunk or that’s all room service has to offer and the two nubile
And semigloss semi-nude swoon-beams in my bed right now
Can’t think of anything left to say except
‘Mimosa! We are sensitive herbs. Mimosa! S’il te plait!’

And it does very much, the playing. Never sipping on the Crissy again.

Sometimes you have to sacrifice what you stand for to keep standing.
It really is a hard knock life.
I’m sure J-hova would understand.
He knows it’s tough out here.

He knows the world is a taking for us takers to take.
He knows the new intelligence
Is sex, cash, and fashion.
That music is an extravagance.

That the new poetry is seeded deeply in luxury.
That desire is an unfaithful lie.
That there is no true hedonism left when you are true to yourself.
He knows; there are no real ghosts in a Phantom Drophead coupe,

That the past will haunt you but can’t chase you if you’re driving
A V12, that survival is the diametrical
opposite but not the antithesis of Art. He’s right—
Armand de Brignac is just as boss and the bottle is more player.

(As a poet, given the choice, I will always concede
to good taste.) Luckily there’s a concierge for everything.
So I’m going to pop these corks
And toast ‘We are alone!”
There’s no one here that will not condone
The bubbles so no one here will condemn the bubbly. _Votre santé_!

The fact of the matter is a matter of faction,
the same legended
thing is the same legal thang. No matter what we name it,
it is what it always has been;
the same old condom you were born with, if you’re lucky,
a couple championship rings or a song listened
to more than twice.

Always singular never alone. Never Alone, Singular Always.
