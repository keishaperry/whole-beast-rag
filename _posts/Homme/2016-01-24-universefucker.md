On a mission to the center of a planet I lost protection.  
I came up empty.  
I wanted to play just the tip,  
instead stretched ozone to breaking point.  

The objectification of land mass  
can’t abstain at high velocities.  
In & out & in  
the goddamn cosmos recoils at my touch.  

I don’t take messages.
