**Article 2**

I am not enough. And in the den, my mother distilled  
perfume from fear and when that splintered, I swallowed  
like the baby, like the baby’s shrillness. My skin shivers like wood  
my own mother moving in opposite directions. I do the dishes,  
if you know what I mean, I do them. Retreat, retread  
the carpet from the pacing, so much prescribed pacing.  
Are these my knuckles? This could not have been the cinching  
of my life. That I do not recall.

_Addendum:_

Your father smokes in the backyard  
through the window  
a thin stream of blue  
between his fingers  
feet pointed north 
he says it’s manly  
like the steering wheel of a ship  
laminate cuffs pegged  
shims &nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp; fix-its I-beams  
the epoxy hardens the belief  
of death &nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp; which wafts  
who are we kidding here? Darlings  
someone will die here  
your mother will die here  
a woman will die here  
a hymn &nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp; a hymn &nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;for mouths  
whisper &nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp; mama  
in the split level  
she is Venus and  
the hymns fly around her  
like dandelion fuzz &nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;wisp  
whirl &nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp; and it is all she thinks of  
bless her &nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp;&nsbp; but the baby  
is just a girl, just a baby, a girl.
