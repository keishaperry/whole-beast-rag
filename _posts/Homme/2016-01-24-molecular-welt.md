After breaking my daytime fast, I’m where the bombing judges gay people,  
Where there’s time to form what I’ve eaten into phalluses commemorating love.  
And my soul says: fondle babies high in the unseeing.  
For if the light drips from a corner, the little genitals stagnate.  
And I dream a movie of the tongue’s miscarriages:  
Its constellation smells coddle submarine shells drunk on spiral eyelids.  
My sleep is glaucoma and depth charges falling through martyrs.
