&nbsp;&nbsp;Such curated remains  

as the ring you wore to sleep in Emily Dickinson’s back  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yard in 1973, a pewter woman’s face  

that reminds me of Converge now;  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as weird American currency and notes  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;toward a novel, _The Loom of Descent_, about greedy, furtive sons—  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its lush psychic backdrop a  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grimoire of our average action  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One out of two trustees agree they’re worth saving  

I too reap a decade’s scant scaffold of myths  

&nbsp;&nbsp;Ceremonial dog burial, half hour hike, day trip to the caves  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our plain eon takes form
