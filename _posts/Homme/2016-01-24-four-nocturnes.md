The murderer is beautiful, and with a deep-sea ugliness.  
Our hunting fire howls on the plateau framed in an office.  
The man is a chair sat in by gargoyles and bedwetting angels.  
His murderer pays my moderate rent to God, plotter of croaking.  
The medicine I need would fill a megacity  
Of mating dogs creaming for children bored as eels.  
I had wanted wolves and less than this.
